Summary: This final rule promulgates new United States Standards for Grades of Whipped Butter. These standards establish quality criteria for grade determination and optional microbiological and keeping-quality tests for whipped butter. The Department has determined that the grading of butter sold in consumer-size packages bearing USDA official identification (grade-label) should be conducted when the product is in the final package. Previously, the quality of whipped butter was evaluated prior to the whipping process using the U.S. Standards for Grades of Butter. The U.S. Standards for Grades of Whipped Butter change this procedure.
Text: DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 58 Grading and Inspection, General Specifications for Approved Plants and Standards for Grades of Dairy Products; United States Standards for Grades of Whipped Butter AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule promulgates new United States Standards for Grades of Whipped Butter. These standards establish quality criteria for grade determination and optional microbiological and keeping-quality tests for whipped butter. The Department has determined that the grading of butter sold in consumer-size packages bearing USDA official identification (grade-label) should be conducted when the product is in the final package. Previously, the quality of whipped butter was evaluated prior to the whipping process using the U.S. Standards for Grades of Butter. The U.S. Standards for Grades of Whipped Butter change this procedure. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Diane D. Lewis, Dairy Products Marketing Specialist, Dairy Standardization Branch, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, room 2750-S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456, (202) 720-7473. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule does not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. The final rule also has been reviewed in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, has determined that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because use of the standards is voluntary and this action will not increase costs to those utilizing the standards. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. In 1991, the Department evaluated the procedures used to assign U.S. grades to butter in consumer-size packages. The Department concluded that grading of the product should be conducted in the final package because the evaluation of whipped butter at that time is more accurate. Previously, the procedure for evaluating grade-label whipped butter was to either grade the butter in the bulk form prior to whipping or obtain a sample of fresh butter taken during the manufacturing process and evaluate it. These methods are changed by this action because of the Department's decision to conduct grading in the final package. The new standards have received general support from many of the manufacturers of whipped butter who utilize the USDA grade-label program, as well as from the American Butter Institute. In addition, the standards were field-tested by the Dairy Grading Branch and found to be satisfactory. In view of the need for new standards, the Department published on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34937) proposed United States Standards for Whipped Butter. Except for minor format changes, the standards contained in this final rule are the same as those set forth in the proposal. The new standards establish the following. 1. Provide Quality Specifications for Whipped Butter at Two U.S. Grade Levels: U.S. Grade AA and U.S. Grade A Whipped butter is produced by uniformly incorporating air or inert gas into butter to improve its spreadability characteristics. The percent overrun, based on buyer or consumer preference, is usually between 50 and 100 percent. Market analysis conducted during the development of these standards supports the opinion that consumers prefer the higher quality products. Therefore, standards are established for quality designations at two levels: U.S. Grade AA and U.S. Grade A.

Summary: 
Text: 2. Define Flavor Characteristics Production and processing practices influence flavor characteristics in whipped butter. To manufacture whipped butter with a highly pleasing flavor, the raw milk and cream must be free of objectionable flavors. This final rule defines acceptable flavor characteristics to assist the graders in identifying and classifying the flavor. 3. Define Body, Color, and Salt Characteristics and Establish Disratings Just as production and processing practices influence the flavor of whipped butter, they also influence body, color, and salt characteristics. This final rule describes distinguishing body, color, and salt characteristics and establishes disratings which are used to determine the U.S. grade. 4. Illustrate How Flavor, Body, Color, and Salt Characteristics Influence Grade Determination These standards provide step-by-step instructions in determining the final grade of whipped butter. The U.S. grade of whipped butter is determined on the basis of classifying first the flavor characteristics. Then body, color, and salt characteristics are noted and disratings established. When total disratings exceed the permitted amount identified in the standards, the final U.S. grade is lowered. 5. Establish Optional Microbiological and Keeping-Quality Tests (Not Mandatory for Grade Designation) Since 1975, the General Specifications for Dairy Plants Approved for USDA Inspection and Grading Service have required microbiological and keeping-quality testing of whipped butter bearing USDA official identification. The market analysis conducted during the development of these standards revealed that the industry utilized tighter microbiological specifications for proteolytic and yeast and mold counts than those listed in the ``General Specifications''. To be more aligned with current industry standards, this final rule tightens these microbiological requirements. This final rule also incorporates these same tests as optional tests (not mandatory for grade designation) in the United States Standards for Grades of Whipped Butter. This final rule also makes corollary changes in the General Specifications for Dairy Plants Approved for USDA Inspection and Grading Service (subpart B of 7 CFR part 58) to conform the definition and grade designations of whipped butter set forth therein with the new United States Standards for Grades of Whipped Butter (in subpart G of 7 CFR part 58). USDA grade standards are voluntary standards that are developed pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq .) to facilitate the marketing process. Manufacturers of dairy products are free to choose whether or not to use these grade standards. USDA grade standards for dairy products have been developed to identify the degree of quality in the various products. Quality in general refers to usefulness, desirability, and value of the product_its marketability as a commodity. When whipped butter is officially graded, the USDA regulations and standards governing the grading of manufactured or processed dairy products are used. These regulations also require a charge for the grading service provided by USDA. This action makes minor format changes for purposes of clarity to Tables I and III to the format that appeared in the proposed rule. Public Comments On June 30, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule (58 FR 34937) to promulgate the United States Standards for Whipped Butter. The public comment period closed August 30, 1993. No comments were received during this time.

Summary: 
Text: §58.2426 Butter. The food product usually known as butter, and which is made exclusively from milk or cream, or both, with or without common salt, with or without additional coloring matter, and containing not less than 80 percent by weight of milkfat, all tolerances having been allowed for. §58.2427 Cream. The term cream when used in this subpart G means cream separated from milk produced by healthy cows. The cream shall be pasteurized at a temperature of not less than 165 ○F and held continuously in a vat at such temperature for not less than 30 minutes; or pasteurized at a temperature of not less than 185 ○F for not less than 15 seconds; or pasteurized by other approved methods giving equivalent results. U.S. Grades §58.2428 Nomenclature of U.S. grades. The nomenclature of U.S. grades is as follows: (a) U.S. Grade AA. (b) U.S. Grade A. §58.2429 Basis for determination of U.S. grade. The U.S. grade of whipped butter is determined on the basis of classifying first the flavor characteristics and then the characteristics in body, color, and salt of a representative sample. Flavor is the basic quality factor in grading whipped butter and is determined organoleptically by smell and taste. The flavor characteristic and intensity is identified and rated according to the applicable classification contained in Table I in §58.2430. When more than one flavor characteristic is discernible in a sample of whipped butter, the flavor classification of the sample shall be established on the basis of the flavor that carries the lowest rating. Body, color, and salt characteristics are then noted and disratings are made in accordance with the established classification in Table II in §58.2430. The final U.S. grade for the sample is then established in accordance with the flavor classification, subject to permitted disratings for body, color, and salt as outlined in §58.2431. §58.2430 Specifications for U.S. grades. The specifications for the U.S. grades of whipped butter are as follows: (a) U.S. Grade AA. U.S. Grade AA whipped butter conforms to the following: Shall possess a fine and highly pleasing butter flavor. Whipped butter may also have a lactic culture flavor. May possess a slight feed, or a definite cooked flavor. The permitted disratings in body, color, and salt characteristics are limited to one-half (1/2). For detailed specifications and classification of flavor characteristics, see Table I of this section. For body, color, and salt disratings, see Table II of this section. (b) U.S. Grade A. U.S. Grade A whipped butter conforms to the following: Shall possess a pleasing and desirable butter flavor. Whipped butter may also have a lactic culture flavor. May possess to a slight degree the following flavors: acid, aged, bitter, coarse, flat, smothered, and storage. May possess a definite feed flavor. The permitted disratings in body, color, and salt characteristics are limited to one-half (1/2). For detailed specifications and classification of flavor characteristics, see Table I of this section. For body, color, and salt disratings, see Table II of this section. (c) General. Whipped butter of all U.S. grades shall be free from foreign materials and visible mold. When total disratings exceed the permitted amount, the final U.S. grade shall be lowered one grade level for each additional one-half (1/2) disrating.

Text: §58.2431 Relationship of U.S. grade of whipped butter to the flavor classifications as affected by disratings in body, color, and salt characteristics. When the disratings for body, color, and salt exceed the permitted amount of (1/2) for any flavor classification, the final U.S. grade shall be lowered accordingly: Table III 1Flavor classification 1Total disratings 1U.S. grade AA 1/2 AA AA 1 A AA 11/2 (*) A 1/2 A A 1 (*) (*) = No U.S. grade assigned. §58.2432 Optional tests. (a) There are optional tests (not mandatory for grade designation) that may be made on whipped butter that can be requested by the buyer or seller. If requested, the product must comply with the microbiological and keeping-quality specifications as follows: Proteolytic count_not more than 50 per gram Yeast and mold count_not more than 10 per gram Coliform count_not more than 10 per gram Keeping-quality test_satisfactory after 7 days at 70 ○F. (b) All required tests, and optional tests when specified, shall be performed in accordance with the test methods identified in §58.2434. §58.2433 U.S. grade not assignable. Whipped butter shall not be assigned a U.S. grade for one or more of the following reasons: (a) The butter fails to meet or exceed the requirements for U.S. Grade A. (b) The butter, when tested, does not comply with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the minimum milkfat requirements of 80.0 percent. (c) The butter is produced in a plant that is rated ineligible for USDA grading service or is not USDA-approved. §58.2434 Test methods. Testing methods contained in the latest edition of the ``Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products'' or the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists'' are used to determine bacterial estimates and milkfat content. Explanation of Terms §58.2435 Explanation of terms. (a) With respect to flavor intensity and characteristics: (1) Slight. Detected only upon critical examination. (2) Definite. Not intense but detectable. (3) Acid. Lacks a delicate flavor or aroma and is associated with an acid condition but there is no indication of sourness. (4) Aged. Characterized by lack of freshness. (5) Bitter. Astringent, similar to taste of quinine and produces a puckery sensation. (6) Coarse. Lacks a fine, delicate, smooth flavor. (7) Cooked. Smooth, nutty-like characteristic resembling a custard flavor. (8) Feed. Aromatic flavor characteristic of the feed eaten by cows. (9) Flat. Lacks natural butter flavor. (10) Smothered. Suggestive of improperly cooked cream. (11) Storage. Characterized by a lack of freshness and more intensified than ``aged'' flavor. (b) With respect to body: (1) Free moisture. ``Free moisture'' is present when beads of moisture are visible on the surface of the sample. The intensity is described as ``slight'' when the droplets or beads of moisture are barely visible, few in number, and about the size of a pinhead; and ``definite'' when the moisture droplets are clearly visible, more numerous, and are somewhat larger in size. (2) Mealy or grainy. A ``mealy'' or ``grainy'' condition imparts a granular consistency when the whipped butter is melted on the tongue. The intensity is described as ``slight'' when the mealiness or graininess is barely detectable; and ``definite'' when the mealiness or graininess is clearly detectable. (c) With respect to color: (1) Mottled. ``Mottled'' appears as a dappled condition with spots of lighter and deeper shades of yellow. The intensity is described as ``slight'' when the small spots of different shades of yellow, irregular in shape, are barely discernible on the sample of whipped butter; and ``definite'' when the mottles are more clearly discernible. (2) Color specks. ``Specks'' usually appear in whipped butter as small white or yellow spots. The intensity is described as ``slight'' when the spots are few in number; and ``definite'' when they are noticeable in larger numbers. (3) Wavy. ``Wavy'' color in whipped butter is an unevenness in the color that appears as waves of different shades of yellow. The intensity is described as ``slight'' when the waves are barely discernible; and ``definite'' when they are readily noticeable. (d) With respect to salt: (1) Gritty. A ``gritty'' salt condition imparts a sand-like feeling on the tongue due to grains of undissolved salt. The intensity is described as ``slight'' when only a few grains of undissolved salt are detected; and ``definite'' when the condition is more readily noticeable. (2) Sharp. ``Sharp'' salt is characterized by taste sensations suggestive of salt. The intensity is described as ``slight'' when the salt taste predominates in flavor; and ``definite'' when the taste distinctly predominates in flavor. Dated: January 3, 1994.

Text: 7 CFR Parts 906 and 928 Amendment 1] Finalization of Interim Final Rules for Specified Marketing Orders (Oranges, Grapefruit, and Papayas) AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of the interim final rules that authorized expenses and established assessment rates for the Texas Valley Citrus Committee and the Papaya Administrative Committee (Committees) under Marketing Order Nos. 906 and 928, respectively. Authorization of these budgets enables the Committees to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer their respective programs. Funds to administer these programs are derived from assessments on handlers. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Britthany E. Beadle, Marketing Order Administration Branch, F&V, AMS, USDA, P.O.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 906 [7 CFR part 906] regulating the handling of oranges and grapefruit grown in the lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas; and Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 928, as amended [7 CFR part 928] regulating the handling of papayas grown in Hawaii. The marketing orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, oranges and grapefruit grown in Texas and papayas grown in Hawaii are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rates specified herein will be applicable to all assessable oranges, grapefruit, and papayas handled during the 1993-94 fiscal year, beginning August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994 (M.O. 906), and July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994 (M.O. 928). This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

Summary: 
Text: There are approximately 135 handlers of oranges and grapefruit, and 120 handlers of papayas subject to regulation under their respective marketing orders each season. In addition, there are approximately 2,500 orange and grapefruit producers in Texas, and 300 papaya producers in Hawaii. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of the orange, grapefruit, and papaya producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. The respective marketing orders require that the assessment rates for a particular fiscal year shall apply to all assessable oranges, grapefruit, and papayas handled from the beginning of such year. An annual budget of expenses is prepared by each Committee and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committees are handlers and producers of the regulated commodities. They are familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. The assessment rates recommended by the Committees are derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of oranges, grapefruit, and papayas. Because these rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established at rates which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committees' expected expenses. The recommended budgets and rates of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committees shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committees will have funds to pay their expenses. An interim final rule was issued for the Texas Valley Citrus Committee (TVCC), on July 7, 1993, and published in the Federal Register [58 FR 37635, July 13, 1993] effective for the period August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994, with a 30-day comment period ending August 12, 1993. The interim final rule authorized expenses of $984,319 and an assessment rate of $0.15 per 7/10 bushel carton for the 1993-94 fiscal year. No comments were filed on the expenses and assessment rate in the interim final rule. The TVCC met again on August 3, 1993, and unanimously recommended increasing authorized expenses to $1,180,925, a $196,606 increase from the previously authorized amount. The TVCC also unanimously recommended increasing the assessment rate from $0.15 per 7/10 bushel carton to $0.18 per 7/10 bushel carton, a $0.03 increase per 7/10 bushel carton from the previously established assessment rate. An amended interim final rule was issued on October 7, 1993, and published in the Federal Register [58 FR 53111, October 14, 1993] effective for the period August 1, 1993 through July 31, 1994, and provided a 30-day comment period. This amended interim final rule increased authorized expenses to $1,180,925, and increased the assessment rate to $0.18 per 7/10 bushel carton of assessable oranges and grapefruit for the 1993-94 fiscal year under the order. The $196,606 expense increase is necessary to provide additional funds for order operations, including $172,606 to fund increased administrative and compliance expenses, primarily for the maintenance of road guard stations, and $24,000 to cover a shortfall in the Mexican Fruit Fly support program. The increase in the assessment rate along with the withdrawal of additional funds from the TVCC's reserves, will adequately fund the increased expenses.

Summary: 
Text: An amended interim final rule was issued for the Papaya Administrative Committee (PAC), on June 14, 1993, and published in the Federal Register [58 FR 33759, June 21, 1993] effective for the period July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994, with a 30-day comment period ending July 21, 1993. The interim final rule authorized expenses of $700,580 and an assessment rate of $0.0085 per pound of fresh papayas for the 1993-94 fiscal year. No comments were filed on the expenses and assessment rate in the interim final rule. However, the PAC met again on August 13, 1993, and unanimously recommended decreasing authorized expenses from $700,580 to $597,860, a $102,720 decrease in expenses from the authorized amount. The PAC also unanimously recommended decreasing the assessment rate from $0.0085 to $0.0069, a $0.0016 decrease in the assessment rate, based upon 58 million pounds of fresh papayas, from the previously established assessment rate. An amended interim final rule was issued on October 7, 1993, and published in the Federal Register [58 FR 53117, October 14, 1993] effective for the period July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994, and provided a 30-day comment period. This amended interim final rule decreased authorized expenses to $597,860, and reduced the assessment rate to $0.0069 per pound of fresh papayas for the 1993-94 fiscal year under the order. Program income for the PAC decreased from $701,660 to $599,356, a $102,304 decrease from the previous estimate. Major program income reductions come from a $92,800 decrease in assessment income due to the lower assessment rate and a $9,504 reduction in income from the Department's Foreign Agricultural Service. The $102,720 decrease in expenses results from reductions in a number of expense items. Major expense reductions include expenditures for salaries and wages, office rent, auto expenses, and Japanese advertising and promotion. The projected income over expenses has increased from $1,080 to $1,496, a $416 increase from the previous amount. The excess funds will be added to the PAC's operational reserve. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amended interim final rules were published in the Federal Register [58 FR 53111 October 14, 1993], for 7 CFR part 906, and [58 FR 53117, October 14, 1993], for 7 CFR part 928. Each interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received. It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register [5 U.S.C. 553]. The Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1993-94 fiscal years for the programs began on August 1, 1993, for Texas citrus and July 1, 1993, for Hawaii papayas. The marketing orders require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable oranges, grapefruit, and papayas handled during the fiscal years. In addition, handlers are aware of these actions which were recommended by the Committees at public meetings and published in the Federal Register as interim final rules. No comments were received concerning the two interim final rules that are adopted in this action as final rules without change.

Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456; telephone: (202) 720-5127. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This document is issued under Marketing Order Nos. 907 and 908 [7 CFR parts 907 and 908], as amended, regulating the handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated parts of California, hereinafter referred to as the ``orders.'' These orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' The Department of Agriculture is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this action. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

Summary: 
Text: There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges and 125 handlers of Valencia oranges who are subject to regulation under the respective marketing order and approximately 3,750 producers of navel oranges and 3,700 producers of Valencia oranges in the regulated areas. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California-Arizona navel and Valencia oranges may be classified as small entities. This rule invites comments on two changes to the reporting requirements currently prescribed under the California-Arizona orange marketing orders. This rule suspends language in the orders and in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue the use of Form 8 (Certificate of Assignment of Allotment) and Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment). These changes were unanimously recommended by the committees. Currently, sections 907.58 and 908.58 of the navel and Valencia orange marketing orders specify that, for the handling of oranges other than by rail car (primarily truck shipments), handlers issue to the consignee an assignment of allotment certificate covering each quantity of oranges so handled. Sections 907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations require handlers to submit such information on Form 8. Handlers are also required to segregate the information on Form 8 by size of oranges shipped and destination (i.e., U.S. and Alaska or Canada). Since the inception of the orders, the committees have utilized Form 8 primarily for tracking and verifying truck shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume regulation features of the orders suspended [58 FR 53,114; October 14, 1993], the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8 creates an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary. According to the committees, many handlers have long questioned the value of Form 8 (commonly referred to in the industry as ``the daily truck ticket'') during periods of no volume regulation. Shipment information from Form 8 is transferred to Form 4 (Weekly Report). Handlers maintain their own manifest records of these shipments and, without weekly volume regulation, Form 4 provides similar data with the exception of number of cartons shipped by size. The committees plan on requesting size information from handlers as needed on a voluntary basis and anticipate revising the weekly Form 4 at a later time to provide for the collection of size information. Thus, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8, particularly during periods of no volume regulation, is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending sections 907.58 and 908.58 of the orders and §§907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 8 will be discontinued.

Summary: 
Text: The second change that the committees recommended concerns Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment). Currently, sections 907.71 and 908.71 of the orange orders provide that handlers furnish to the committees information regarding cartons of oranges handled, segregated by size, within 24 hours of shipment. Handlers must also indicate whether the shipments were destined to points in the U.S. and Alaska or Canada. Sections 907.141 and 908.141 of the orders' rules and regulations require handlers to submit this information for rail car shipments on Form 3. The information collected on Form 3 is similar to the information collected on Form 8 described earlier, but pertains to rail car shipments rather than truck shipments. Again, this information has historically been utilized primarily for tracking and verifying shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume regulation features of the orders suspended, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, like Form 8, creates an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary. Handlers are also required to submit similar information on rail car shipments on the weekly Form 4. As with size information pertaining to truck shipments, the committees plan on requesting size information from handlers for rail car shipments on a voluntary basis until the weekly Form 4 is appropriately revised. Like Form 8, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, particularly during periods of no volume regulation, is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending §§907.71 and 908.71 of the orders and §§907.141 and 908.141 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 3 will be discontinued. Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB numbers 0581-0116 for navel oranges and 0581-0121 for Valencia oranges. This rule will reduce the reporting burden on approximately 265 handlers of navel and Valencia oranges who have been completing Form 8, taking about .40 hour to complete each report. This rule will also reduce the reporting burden on about 80 orange handlers who ship by rail at some point during a season and utilize Form 3, taking about 0.20 hours to complete each report. After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the committee's recommendation, and other available information, it is found that the provisions detailed below, at this time, do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this action into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) Handlers are currently shipping navel oranges and these actions will reduce the burden of information collection placed on such handlers; (2) the committees unanimously recommended these actions at public meetings and all interested persons had an opportunity to provide input; (3) these actions relax reporting requirements; (4) California-Arizona orange handlers are aware of this action and need no additional time to comply with the relaxed requirements; and (5) this action provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.

Summary: 
Text: Section 910.80 of the order authorizes the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, to establish minimum quantities and types of shipments which shall be free from regulation under this order. Section 910.180(d)(3) of the administrative rules and regulations prescribes procedures governing exemption from volume and size regulations for organic lemons handled in minimum quantities. On July 23, 1993, Mr. Rich Hart, President of Rainbow Valley Orchards, sent a letter to the Committee requesting an increase in the amount of organic lemons a handler may ship free of order regulations to 500 cartons per week. Currently, handlers can ship up to 350 cartons of such lemons weekly. At its August 3, 1993, meeting, the Committee recommended increasing the organic exemption provision from 350 to 500 cartons per week that handlers may ship to organic or health food wholesalers and retailers without regard to volume and size regulations. The vote on the recommendation was 12 in favor and 1 abstention. The person who abstained expressed a concern with the definition of organic. Shippers of organic lemons have indicated that organic fruit markets can absorb more fruit than in the past, and that they need to take advantage of the additional marketing opportunity. The Committee expects the increase in shipments allowed will provide shipping flexibility for organic shippers and will facilitate the marketing of organic lemons. The Committee also believes that sales of organic lemons will not adversely impact sales of regulated lemons. The interim final rule was issued on October 4, 1993, with an effective date of October 8, 1993, and published in the Federal Register [58 FR 52401, October 8, 1993]. The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending November 8, 1993, and no comments were received. The interim final rule amended the rules and regulations of the lemon marketing order. This rule modifies language in the order's rules and regulations to increase from 350 to 500 cartons per week, the amount of organic lemons handlers may ship free of order regulations. Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the information collection requirements that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned OMB No. 0581-0120. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 932 (7 CFR part 932), as amended, regulating the handling of olives grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities imported into the United States that are the same as, or comparable to, those imposed upon the domestic commodities under the Federal marketing orders. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

Summary: 
Text: The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are 5 handlers of California olives that will be subject to regulation under the order during the current season, and there are about 1,350 olive producers in California. There are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to the olive import regulation. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR §121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms, have been defined by the Small Business Administration as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000. None of the domestic olive handlers may be classified as small entities. The majority of olive producers and importers may be classified as small entities. This rule finalizes an interim final rule that establishes grade and size requirements for olives grown in California, which are authorized for limited use styles. The interim final rule was published in the September 17, 1993, Federal Register [58 FR 48592], and provided 30 days to interested persons to file comments. No comments were received. This rule also finalizes an interim final rule that authorizes the importation of smaller sized olives for limited uses. The interim final rule was published in the September 17, 1993, Federal Register [58 FR 48595], and provided 30 days for interested persons to file comments. No comments were received. Nearly all of the olives grown in the United States are produced in California. The growing areas are scattered throughout California with most of the commercial production coming from inland valleys. In 1990, about 77 percent of the production came from the San Joaquin Valley and 23 percent from the Sacramento Valley. California olives are primarily used for canned ripe whole and whole pitted olives which are eaten out of hand as hors d'oeuvres or used as an ingredient in cooking and in salads. The canned ripe olive market is essentially a domestic market. Very few shipments of California olives are exported. Olive production has fluctuated from a low of 24,200 tons during the 1972-73 crop year to a high of 168,500 tons during the 1992-93 crop year. The California Olive Committee (committee) indicated that 1991-92 production totalled about 63,260 tons. The various varieties of olives produced in California have alternate bearing tendencies with high production one year and low the next. Total production for the 1992-93 crop year is approximately 163,500 tons. Total production for the 1993-94 crop year is estimated to be 110,000 tons. However, based on past production and marketing experience, the committee believes that handlers will need smaller sized olives during the 1993-94 crop year to meet market requirements for limited use styles of canned olives for the 1993-94 year. Absent this action, olives which are smaller than those authorized for whole and whole pitted canning uses would have to be disposed of by handlers into non-canning uses such as crushing into oil. Paragraph (a)(3) of §932.52 of the order provides that processed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Until October 1, 1991, paragraph (a)(3) also prescribed minimum sizes, by variety group, which could be authorized for use in the production of limited use styles by the Secretary. Effective October 1, 1991, certain non-canning size disposition requirements specified in §932.51(a)(3) and minimum sizes authorized for limited use specified in §932.52(a)(3) of the marketing order were suspended. The committee may now recommend the use of olives for limited uses that are smaller than those previously permitted under the order. Minimum size and grade requirements may be recommended annually by the committee and approved by the Secretary. The sizes authorized herein are the same as those established for the 1992-93 crop year. The minimum sizes which could previously be authorized for limited uses were established in a 1971 amendment to the marketing order. Olives smaller than the prescribed minimum sizes which could be authorized for limited uses had to be disposed of through less profitable non-canning uses such as crushing for oil. Returns to producers are lower on smaller fruit used for such purposes. The use of smaller sized olives for limited use styles has been authorized in all but two crop years since the order was instituted in 1965. Since the 1971 amendment, there have been substantial changes within the olive industry. In spite of the annual limited use authorization, in recent years the industry has not been able to meet market needs for its products, especially the limited use styles used primarily by the food service industry. The demand for processed olives and for limited use styles is expected to continue to increase. At the same time, the industry has not been able to increase production to meet market needs for canned ripe olives. The committee conducted a study during the 1990-91 crop year to determine the feasibility of utilizing smaller sized olives in the production of limited use styles and to determine which sizes could be efficiently processed into such styles. All olive handlers within the industry participated in the study. All handlers reported that smaller sizes can be efficiently processed into limited use styles. Advanced technology in the form of better processing equipment is currently available. The new technology allows handlers to process smaller olives into limited use styles more efficiently than was possible in the past. This action will help growers and handlers to meet the growing market requirements for limited use style olives based upon current conditions. The size requirements allow the use of sizes which would otherwise have to be disposed of for non-canning use. In turn, growers should receive a larger return from such olives. By a mail ballot vote ending June 15, 1993, the committee unanimously recommended establishment of grade and size regulations during the 1993-94 crop year pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of §932.52 of the order. The grade requirements are the same as established in recent seasons. The specific sizes for the variety groups are the minimum sizes which are deemed desirable for use in the production of limited use styles at this time. As in past years, permitting the use of the smaller olives in the production of limited use styles allowed handlers to take advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Handlers will be able to market more olives than would be permitted in the absence of this relaxation in size requirements. This additional opportunity is provided to maximize the use of the available olive supplies and facilitate market expansion, thereby increasing returns to growers. In the absence of this action, the smaller fruit would have to be disposed of for less profitable, non-canning uses. Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements are in effect for olives under a domestic marketing order, imported olives must meet the same or comparable requirements. This action allows smaller olives for limited use styles under the marketing order. Therefore, a corresponding change is needed in the olive import regulation. Canned ripe olives, and bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives, imported into the United States must meet certain minimum grade and size requirements specified in Olive Regulation 1 (7 CFR 944.401). All canned ripe olives are required to be inspected and certified prior to importation (release from custody of the United States Custom Service), and all bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives must be inspected and certified prior to canning. ``Canned ripe olives'' means olives in hermetically sealed containers and heat sterilized under pressure, of two distinct types, ``ripe'' and ``green-ripe'', as defined in the current U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (7 CFR 52.3751-52.3764). The term does not include Spanish-style green olives. Any lot of olives failing to meet the import requirements may be exported or disposed of under the supervision of the Processed Products Branch of the Fruit and Vegetable Division, with the costs of certifying the disposal of the olives borne by the importer. Any person may import up to 100 pounds (drained weight) of canned ripe olives or bulk olives exempt from these grade and size requirements. This final rule modifies paragraph (b)(12) of the olive import regulation (7 CFR 944.401 (b)(12)) to authorize the importation of bulk olives which do not meet the minimum size requirements established for olives for whole and whole pitted uses to be used in the production of limited use styles for the 1993-94 season which begins August 1, 1993. This rule also establishes size regulations for such olives in paragraph (b)(12). Import regulations issued under the Act are based on regulations established under Federal marketing orders to regulate domestically produced products. The grade and size requirements contained in the olive import regulation are based on those in effect for olives grown in California under Marketing Order No. 932. This action reflects a recommendation by the committee to change the requirements for olives for limited use styles grown in California. The committee works with the Department in administering the marketing order program for California olives.

Summary: 
Text: Paragraph (a)(3) of §932.52 of the California olive marketing order provides that processed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. The sizes are specified in terms of minimum weights for individual olives in various size categories by variety groups. This is to recognize the different sizing characteristics of the individual varieties and types of California olives. Olives used in limited use styles are too small to be desirable for use as whole or whole pitted canned olives because their flesh-to-pit ratio is too low. However, they are satisfactory for use in the production of limited use styles. The committee unanimously recommended to authorize establishment of minimum sizes for use in the production of limited use styles during the 1993-94 season. These minimum sizes would be the same as those established for the 1992-93 season. The sizes are specified in terms of minimum weights for individual olives in various variety groups and are the same for both domestic and imported olives. An extra category is continued in the import regulation to apply comparable requirements for varieties not grown domestically. The minimum sizes are as follows: Variety Group I, except the Ascolano, Barouni, or St. Agostino varieties_1/105 pound Variety Group I of the Ascolano, Barouni, or St. Agostino varieties_1/180 pound Variety Group 2, except the Obliza variety_1/205 pound Variety Group 2 of the Obliza variety_1/180 pound Olives not identifiable as to variety or variety group_1/205 pound Each of the categories includes a 35 percent tolerance for olives weighing less than the specified minimum size. This action is necessary because section 8e of the Act provides that when domestically produced olives are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imported olives must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements. Thus, authorizing the use of smaller sized California olives in the production of limited use styles and establishing size regulations for such olives requires that the same or comparable regulations be issued for imported bulk olives. Permitting the use of smaller olives in the production of limited use styles will allow importers to take better advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Importers will be able to import and market more olives than would be permitted in the absence of this relaxation in size requirements. This additional opportunity is provided to maximize the use of the available olive supply and facilitate market expansion. In the absence of this action, the smaller fruit could not be imported for limited uses, and would have to be disposed of through less profitable, non-canning uses under the supervision of the inspection service or exported. A change in paragraph (c) to be implemented indefinitely, updates the list of regional inspection offices listed in the import regulation. The change reflects consolidation of the Southeastern and Central offices into the Eastern Regional Office and the relocation of the Western Regional Office. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this final rule. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee, and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rules, without change, as published in the Federal Register [FR 58 48592 and 48595], will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. List of Subjects 7 CFR Part 932 Marketing agreements, Olives, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. List of Subjects 7 CFR Part 944 Avocados, Food grades and standards, Grapefruit, Grapes, Imports, Kiwifruit, Limes, Olives, and Oranges. For the reasons set forth in the preamble 7 CFR parts 932 and 944 are amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR Parts 932 and 944 are revised to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 601-674. PART 932_OLIVES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA 2. Accordingly, the interim final rule revising the provisions of §932.153, which was published in the September 17, 1993, Federal Register [58 FR 48592], is adopted as a final rule without change. PART 944_FRUITS; IMPORT REGULATIONS 3. Accordingly, the interim final rule amending the provisions of §944.401, which was published in the September 17, 1993, Federal Register [58 FR 48595], is adopted as a final rule without change.

Text: 7 CFR Part 1106 Milk in the Southwest Plains Marketing Area; Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Suspension of rule. SUMMARY: This document suspends indefinitely certain portions of a provision of the Southwest Plains Federal milk marketing order (Order 106), beginning on the date this document is published in the Federal Register . The suspension will allow transfers of Class I fluid milk products from a distributing plant to other plants regulated under Order 106 to be counted as part of the distributing plant's route sales for the purpose of determining the plant's pool status under the order. The suspension was requested by Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI), and Mid-America Dairymen, Inc. (Mid-America), who stated that it was necessary to restore equity among producers supplying handlers regulated under Order 106. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nicholas Memoli, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456, (202) 690-1932. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Prior document in this proceeding: Notice of Proposed Suspension: Issued November 23, 1993; published November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63120). The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this final rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This suspension will lessen the opportunity for disorderly marketing conditions and will tend to ensure that dairy farmers continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900).

Summary: 
Text: Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63120), concerning the proposed suspension of certain words from the route disposition definition of Order 106. The public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the notice by submitting written data, views, and arguments by December 7, 1993. One comment letter was received. After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice and other available information, it is hereby found and determined that the following provision of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Southwest Plains marketing area will not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act for an indefinite period commencing with the publication of this document in the Federal Register : In §1106.3, the parenthetical phrase ``(except to a plant)''. Statement of Consideration This document will suspend certain words from the route disposition definition of the order. The effect of this change will be to include transfers of fluid milk products to other plants regulated under Order 106 in determining if the transferor plant meets the pool qualification requirements specified in §1106.7(a) of the order. According to Mid-America and AMPI, two cooperative associations representing a substantial number of producers whose milk is pooled under Order 106, a Tulsa, Oklahoma, handler receiving milk from non-member producers is also supplied supplemental milk from cooperative associations that pool milk on the Southwest Plains milk order. The proponents argued that as a result of excluding transfers of fluid milk products to other plants regulated under Order 106, the handler has been a partially regulated plant in recent months and could be again in the future. Mid-America and AMPI explained that, since the handler's Class I utilization is higher than the market's average, the handler has been able to pay its non-member producers a price in excess of the order's blend price. In addition to the inequity resulting from this price disparity, AMPI, during the month of September, was required to depool milk that it had diverted from the Tulsa plant because the plant otherwise would have failed to qualify as a pool plant during the month of September. This resulted in additional financial loss to the cooperative. A letter supporting the suspension was filed on behalf of the proponents. There were no comment letters received in opposition to the suspension. It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest in that: (a) The suspension is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions in the marketing area; (b) This suspension does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective date; and (c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given to interested parties, and they were afforded opportunity to file written data, views, or arguments concerning this suspension. Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication in the Federal Register . List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1106 Milk marketing orders. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, title 7, part 1106 is amended as follows: PART 1106_MILK IN THE SOUTHWEST PLAINS MARKETING AREA 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 1106, continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 1-19, 48 Stat. 31, as amended; 7 U.S.C. 601-674. §1106.3 [Suspended] 2. In §1106.3 the phrase ``(except to a plant)'' is suspended. Dated: January 3, 1994.

Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or the ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270. B. South Dakota South Dakota initially received final authorization in November 1984. Revisions to the program were approved on June 17, 1991, June 29, 1992, and September 8, 1993. EPA has reviewed South Dakota's application, and has made an immediate final decision that South Dakota's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to South Dakota. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until February 9, 1994. Copies of South Dakota's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. Approval of South Dakota's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. A draft application was submitted on April 30, 1993. The State of South Dakota addressed all of EPA's concerns prior to submittal of the final application. Thus, the South Dakota program is granted immediate final authorization for the provisions in the following Table.

Summary: 
Text: C. Decision I conclude that South Dakota's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, South Dakota is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. South Dakota has not requested authorization to operate its hazardous waste program, as revised, in ``Indian Country'' as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151. Accordingly, today's decision to grant South Dakota final hazardous waste authorization, as revised, does not extend to Indian Country. The Environmental Protection Agency retains all hazardous waste authority under RCRA which applies to ``Indian Country'' in South Dakota. South Dakota now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its revised program application and previously approved authorities. South Dakota also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to issue orders under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. South Dakota has agreed to submit a draft application for RCRA cluster 1 and land disposal restriction rules by December 31, 1993, a draft application for RCRA cluster 2 by December 31, 1994. Final applications will be submitted within 60 working days of receipt of EPA's comments on the draft application. The State has agreed to submit a final application for the TC rules within six months of EPA's decision on the proposed rule (December 24, 1992) to suspend the Toxicity Characteristics rule (Hazardous Waste Codes D018 through D043). Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of South Dakota's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Chronic renal failure (CRF) is a progressive and usually irreversible decline in kidney function that does not always require regular dialysis. However, CRF patients who have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) do require a regular course of dialysis or kidney transplantation in order to sustain life. Section 299I of the Social Security Amendments of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-603) established the Medicare ESRD benefit by extending coverage to any individual who requires either dialysis or transplantation and meets the following requirements: •Is fully or currently insured or entitled to monthly benefits under title II of the Social Security Act; or •Is the spouse or dependent child of the insured or entitled individual. The methods and amounts of payment for services to ESRD patients have changed over the years and are currently set forth in §§410.50, 410.52, and 413.170-413.179 of the HCFA rules. Law and program policy have moved over the years towards encouraging greater use of self-dialysis and home dialysis. On June 1, 1989, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the generic drug epoetin which we commonly refer to as ``EPO''. EPO is a sterile, colorless, preservative-free, liquid, biologically engineered protein that stimulates the bone marrow to make new red blood cells. EPO may be covered under the Medicare program when used to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure. Most chronic renal failure patients are anemic because their kidneys are unable to produce sufficient amounts of a substance called erythropoietin. Patients with chronic renal failure include those who require renal dialysis and are eligible for Medicare under the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) provisions of the law. In accordance with the labeling approved by the FDA, EPO may be administered either intravenously or subcutaneously for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure or anemia induced by the drug AZT used by patients with the HIV virus. Individuals with chronic renal failure use the drug to elevate or maintain the red blood cell level (as measured by the hematocrit or hemoglobin level) and to decrease the need for blood transfusions. Chronic renal patients considered for initiation of EPO therapy should generally have a hematocrit of less than 30%. In July, 1989, we issued instructions in the Provider Reimbursement Manual_Part 1 (Chapter 27, Transmittal 11) authorizing Medicare contractors to start paying for the drug EPO, as of June 1, 1989. Coverage instructions were issued in November 1989 in the Intermediary Manual_Part 3 (Transmittal 1449), Carriers Manual_Part 3 (Transmittal 1329), Hospital Manual (Transmittal 576) and the Renal Dialysis Facility Manual (Transmittal 42). The effective date of the coverage instructions was also June 1, 1989. The Medicare regulations were not amended at that time. Before enactment of Public Law 101-508 (OBRA '90), home use of EPO was not covered. For patients who dialyzed at home to receive Medicare payment for EPO, the drug had to be administered either in an ESRD facility or as a service ``incident to'' a physician's professional services. II. Statutory Provisions Section 4201(d)(1) of OBRA '90 amended section 1861(s)(2) of the Act by adding a new subparagraph (Q) that_ •Provides for coverage, effective July 1, 1991, of EPO that is used by home dialysis patients who are competent to use the drug without medical or other supervision and for coverage of items related to administration of the drug; and •Requires the Secretary to establish by regulation methods and standards for the safe and effective use of the drug at home.

US Department: 
Summary: 
Text: Section 4201(c) of that same law provided for payment for EPO furnished to ESRD patients by Medicare approved dialysis facilities to be made at the rate of $11 per 1,000 units, rounded to the nearest 100 units, effective January 1, 1991. Section 13566 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93, Pub. L. 103-66) sets the rate at $10 per 1,000 units effective January 1, 1994. Typically, EPO is administered at the end of the dialysis treatment. Therefore, unless medical documentation shows that it is necessary to administer EPO at a time other than during dialysis, payment for patients who dialyze at a facility is made only to the facility. The change made by section 13555(b) of OBRA '93, which provides for coverage of EPO self-administered by any dialysis patient (not limited to those who dialyze at home) will be implemented by separate regulations. For home use of EPO supplied to a home dialysis patient competent to administer the drug without medical supervision, HCFA pays only a Medicare approved dialysis facility or a supplier of home dialysis equipment and supplies, if the patient obtains the drug directly from the supplier. In either case, payment for home use of EPO is made at the rate described above. If a home patient is competent to use EPO without supervision and the drug has been prescribed, generally the patient's dialysis facility would furnish it. If a physician administers EPO to the patient, it should be the physician who receives the Monthly Capitation Payment (MCP) for furnishing the beneficiary's renal-related services. If a physician other than the MCP physician furnishes EPO, this physician must look to the MCP physician for payment for EPO administration. In this latter case, HCFA pays on a reasonable charge basis for the drug, but makes no additional payment to the physician for administration. HCFA will announce annually, for public comment, whether an update in the EPO allowance is appropriate. By statute, any increase will not exceed the percentage increase (if any) in the implicit price deflator for the gross national product for the second quarter of the preceding year over the implicit price deflator for the second quarter of the second preceding year. III. Provisions of the Interim Final Rule In the interim final rule with comment period, published on September 4, 1991, we made the changes discussed below: A. Major changes. We amended subpart U of part 405 of the HCFA rules, which sets forth the conditions for coverage of services furnished to ESRD beneficiaries, as follows: 1. Patient selection. To ensure the safe and effective use of EPO by home dialysis patients, we amended §405.2163 to require that the patient's dialysis facility or the physician responsible for all dialysis-related services make a comprehensive assessment of the patient and the patient's needs at the time of selection for EPO therapy. We emphasized that proper patient selection is necessary for a safe, effective program of EPO therapy at home. It is necessary for the dialysis facility or the physician responsible for all dialysis-related services to assess_ •Whether the patient will actually be able to administer the drug or have available the necessary assistance from a care-giver; and •Whether the patient complies with certain elements necessary for successful EPO therapy. Accordingly, we required that, in order to be selected for home use of EPO, a patient must_ •Be a home dialysis patient (either peritoneal or hemodialysis method). •Have a hematocrit (or comparable hemoglobin) of less than 30 percent unless medical documentation justifies a patient's need for EPO with a hematocrit higher than 30 percent. For example, a patient with severe angina, severe pulmonary disease, or severe hypotension may require EPO to prevent adverse symptoms even though the patient has a higher hematocrit. •Be under the care of the physician who is responsible for the dialysis-related services and who prescribes EPO, and under the care of the renal dialysis facility that establishes the plan of care for the services and monitors the progress of the home EPO therapy. •Be trained by the facility to inject EPO or have an appropriate caregiver who is trained to inject EPO. In addition, as part of the assessment, we required the following: a. The patient's hematocrit (or hemoglobin), serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and blood pressure must be measured. b. An appropriate protocol, developed by the patient's physician or facility and including monitoring of blood pressure, must be given to the patient for the safe and effective use of the drug. c. The patient must be capable of performing self-administration of EPO, be able to learn aseptic technique, and be able to read the drug labeling, or must have a primary care-giver who can perform these tasks. d. The patient must be able to adhere to a disciplined medical regimen. 2. Patient care plan. To ensure adequate monitoring of home EPO therapy, we amended §405.2137(b) to add a new paragraph (b)(7) which requires that the patient plan for a home dialysis patient who uses EPO in the home include the following: •Review of diet and fluid modifications to monitor iron stores and hyperkalemia related to dietary indiscretion or elevated blood pressure. •Reevaluation of the patient's dialysis prescription taking into account the patient's increased appetite and red blood cell volume. •A method of teaching the patient to identify the signs and symptoms of hypotension and hypertension. •The decrease or discontinuance of EPO if hypertension is uncontrolled. •A method of followup on blood work and a means to keep the physician informed of the results. 3. Other concerns. In order to minimize possible abuse of EPO, we revised §405.2163(g)(4) to require that the physician or facility ensure that ``on hand'' EPO is limited to a two-month supply.

Summary: 
Text: We also requested the public's views and suggestions regarding this policy, and any other issues, including whether it is necessary to impose special storage requirements for safe-keeping of EPO, considering that the drug contains no preservatives and that its presence might entail possible risks to children in the household. B. Other minor changes. We also made minor changes to codify in the rules the coverage of EPO in general and to reflect the expansion of that coverage to include EPO used at home by home dialysis patients. (As explained in the ``Background'' section of the preamble to the interim rule, previous coverage of EPO was implemented through general instructions issued by HCFA, but not reflected in the rules.) Section 410.10 We amended this section to show that EPO used at home by home-dialysis patients is now covered as one of the services included in ``Medical and other health services'', as defined in section 1861(s) of the Social Security Act. Section 410.29 We amended this section to show that EPO may be covered as an exception to the general exclusion of drugs that may be self-administered. Section 410.50 We amended this section to show that medically necessary drugs and biologicals are covered as part of institutional dialysis services furnished in a dialysis facility. (EPO covered as a dialysis facility service is paid as an add-on to the facility payment rate.) Section 410.52 We amended this section to show that EPO for use by competent patients in the home is now included in the scope of ESRD services furnished in the patient's home. Section 413.170(a)(1) We amended this section to update the cross references to the ESRD program coverage provisions in the regulations. Section 413.170(c) We added a new paragraph (c)(6) to describe reimbursement for EPO when it is furnished by a Medicare-approved dialysis facility or a supplier of home dialysis equipment and supplies. Sections 414.300 and 414.335 We added a new paragraph (d) to §414.300 and a new §414.335 to specify method of payment for EPO that the beneficiary obtains directly from a supplier of home dialysis equipment and supplies. IV. Discussion of Comments We received fifteen letters of comment from two nephrologists, three renal dietitians, three nephrology nurses, two dialysis centers, two professional associations, one home health agency, one medicare carrier, and one law firm. A. Patient Selection Comment: Two commenters, both nephrologists, recommended that EPO be given for patients with hematocrits greater than 30 percent, even up to 35 percent. One of the commenters stated that a hematocrit of 30 percent is not normal and that in a male, for whom normal hematocrit would be closer to 40 percent, a 30 percent reading means that the individual is functioning at three-quarters of his or her ability to do exercises as well as other things. That, combined with the chronic uremic state, which all dialysis patients have, makes it much more difficult for these patients to function in a useful manner. The commenter believes hematocrits closer to 35 percent would make much more sense for keeping these patients in a normal state and making them generally much more functional. The other commenter stated that his dialysis center is not required to justify continuation of EPO to patients with hematocrits of up to 35 percent. Commenters asked whether justification would be required each month or a single letter of justification would suffice. Response: The drug labeling for EPO recommends dosage to maintain a patient's hematocrit in the range of 30-33 percent (target range) with a maximum of 36 percent. It also states that the dose of EPO should be reduced when the hematocrit reaches the target range of 30-33 percent or increases by more than 4 points in any two-week period. Therapy with EPO can result in an abnormal increase in red blood cells if the hematocrit is not carefully monitored and the dose appropriately adjusted. We believe we are justified in requiring a hematocrit of less than 30 percent for initiation of EPO therapy at home. Thirty percent is the low end of the target range. Medical review guidelines in the manuals used by Medicare intermediaries and carriers provide for payment of subsequent claims for EPO without documentation of medical necessity as long as the hematocrit is below 36 percent. We have revised §405.2163(g)(2) to clarify that the 30 percent hematocrit threshold applies only to initiation of EPO therapy. Comment: One commenter, operating a renal dialysis program in a university hospital, pointed out that, due to the close working relationship that exists between the renal physicians, dialysis staff and outpatient department, a physician may order EPO for an ESRD patient, note that order in the patient's chart, and verbally inform the pharmacist of the order without providing a written prescription. The commenter believes this procedure to be the norm. However, the fiscal intermediary processing those claims will not pay for any claims for which a written prescription is not provided. The commenter believes this process to be burdensome, especially since the order is documented in the patient's medical chart. The commenter also asked whether there will be any policy affecting refillable prescriptions. Response: We are sympathetic to the concerns expressed by the commenter and remain sensitive to requirements that may appear to be overly burdensome. However, we believe the intermediary is justified in requiring a written prescription. While in the case the commenter presented it might seem to create additional paperwork, a written prescription protects the pharmacist as well as providing a basis for payment by the intermediary. The intermediary or carrier has discretion to determine whether to require documentation on refillable prescriptions on the basis of reasonableness and necessity. Comment: The same commenter suggested that we establish more specific guidelines for ``regular monitoring'' of patients who self-administer EPO, especially with regard to maximum hematocrit readings. Two commenters recommended including guidelines similar to those in the manufacturer's labeling. Two other commenters suggested that we include a mechanism for monitoring patient compliance such as the completion of a patient log. Response: The drug labeling for EPO provides general therapeutic guidelines with regard to the starting dose and maintenance dose, as well as when the dose should be reduced or increased. We believe the labeling provides adequate guidelines and that physicians should have the flexibility to interpret those guidelines with regard to their patients. Since drug regimens will vary depending on the individual patient's prescribed plan of treatment, we do not wish to be overly prescriptive with respect to specific monitoring protocols. We have, however, revised language at §405.2163(g)(2)(iii) to require that the physician follow the drug labeling instructions when monitoring the EPO home therapy as well as in developing appropriate protocols. We also agree that a patient log is a valid means to monitor compliance. To encourage use of that mechanism or similar effective mechanisms, we have added ``(such as a patient log)'' in §405.2137(b)(7).

Summary: 
Text: Comment: One commenter asked what type of medical documentation will be required to support payment for occasional use of EPO prior to dialysis, required because of temporary patient weakness or a low hematocrit reading. Response: Medicare eligibility based on ESRD is not established until the patient has been undergoing routine dialysis for three months or has a kidney transplant. Thus it is unlikely that a patient undergoing EPO therapy before dialysis would be a Medicare beneficiary. However, if a beneficiary whose Medicare eligibility is based on age or disability receives EPO for either of the types of anemia listed on the drug labeling, the drug may be covered if furnished ``incident to a physician's service''. Routine documentation requirements for this treatment include appropriate diagnostic coding on the HCFA-1500 claim form filed by the physician. Comment: One commenter stated that the rule implies that home dialysis patients have not been receiving EPO and that the need for EPO must be evaluated for each patient. The commenter points out that many patients have met the criteria for EPO, have been monitored monthly by appropriate laboratory tests and frequent blood pressure checks, and may already have been determined to have hematocrits within the target range. The commenter recommended that we not require full evaluation of patients who are already on EPO. Response: We realize that a patient who is receiving EPO may have a hematocrit within the target range of 30-33 percent. We also realize that any patient considered for home use of EPO would be under the care of a physician who furnishes all dialysis-related services. We assume that, in determining whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for home use, the physician would take into account any previous evaluations and whether the patient is currently receiving EPO. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that every patient must be evaluated before being approved for home use of EPO. The physician may base the evaluation in part on information previously obtained in the course of monitoring dialysis, but must also evaluate other factors, such as competence to inject the drug and capacity for proper storage of the drug, that are not pertinent to receiving EPO in a facility or a physician's office. Comment: One commenter believes that home health agencies (HHAs) should not have to adhere to the standard of ensuring that the two-month supply limitation is met, especially in a patient's own household. The commenter believes that such a standard could impose on the HHA inappropriate and unwarranted liability, especially since EPO is a drug that allegedly ``may be abused.'' The same commenter also requested that the phrase, ``in the judgment of the home health agency,'' be inserted after the word ``patient'' in §405.2163(g)(2) to prevent reviewing agencies from alleging that the patient did not have the abilities necessary to self-administer EPO. Response: Under §405.2163 (g)(2) and (h)(3), the patient's physician or dialysis facility (and not the supplier) is responsible for ensuring that the patient is capable of self-administering the drug and, through the drug prescriptions, that the amount ``on hand'' does not exceed a 2-month supply. Accordingly, if an HHA qualifies to be a supplier of home dialysis equipment and supplies, that HHA would not be subject to the responsibilities that aroused the commenter's concern. Ordinarily, HHAs would not be involved in monitoring self-administration of EPO. Comment: One professional association commented that the wording in §405.2163(g)(2)(iii), that is, ``being able to adhere to a disciplined medical regimen'', is a broad subjective statement that lacks meaning without some measurement of nonadherence. It recommended replacing the language with the words ``be able to meet the requirements of an established home dialysis training program and periodic reassessment by qualified training staff.'' Response: We agree that the cited current language lacks specificity and have removed it. However, we did not add the suggested language because, in this context, it is training in the self-administration of EPO (rather than in self-dialysis as such) that is pertinent, and that is already dealt with in paragraph (g)(3). B. Patient Care Plan Comment: Three commenters, all renal dietitians, questioned the wording of the requirement to review a patient's diet and fluid modifications to monitor adequate iron stores and hyperkalemia. All commented that the amount of iron required during EPO therapy can rarely be met with dietary iron, since such diets are typically iron deficient. They noted that oral or even intravenous supplemental iron is required and recommended that we revise the language to include the following:

Text: •Review of diet and fluid intake for indiscretions as reflected by hyperkalemia and elevated blood pressure secondary to volume overload. •Review of medications for adequate provision of supplemental iron. •Evaluation of hematocrit and measures of iron stores. Response: We agree with these comments and have revised §405.2137(b)(7) (i)-(iii) to include the suggested content. C. Other Concerns Comment: One commenter asked for clarification of the effective date. Response: The law (section 4201(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990) that set the payment rate at $11 per 1,000 units was effective January 1, 1991. However, under section 4201(d) of that Act, coverage of EPO self-administered at home by home dialysis patients is effective July 1, 1991. Thus, Medicare payment is available for services that are furnished on or after that date and that also meet the requirements of the interim final rule published on September 4, 1991. Comment: Two commenters felt that an initial 2-month EPO supply might be too much since (1) patients who receive the drug from a renal facility must be seen by their physician monthly and (2) a 2-month supply might discourage patients from maintaining blood pressure and hematocrit monitoring. The commenters were also concerned that the supplier or renal facility may be requested to take back unused portions of EPO, if the home dialysis patient received a kidney transplant or died soon after receiving the supply. They suggested that a smaller quantity would alleviate the beneficiary's coinsurance responsibility. Response: First, we note that the provision sets the 2-month initial supply as a maximum limit, to be used when circumstances make a 2-month supply appropriate. We recognize that patients who obtain their supplies directly must be monitored monthly, and we would expect a physician to prescribe a lesser amount for some patients. In §405.2163, we have added a paragraph (h) to highlight the responsibilities of the physician and the dialysis facility. Paragraph (h)(3) makes clear that the 2-month supply is a maximum. Comment: One commenter stated that billing procedures instructing an initial billing of up to a 2-month supply followed by subsequent billings limited to a 1-month supply are inconsistent with our proposed regulations which appear to intend that the beneficiary maintain a 2-month supply at all times. Response: The commenter has misinterpreted the intent of the policy. The intent is not to require a ``minimum'' 2-month supply, but rather to ensure that the patient has at least a 1-month supply. As stated above, the physician may initially prescribe ``up to'' a 2-month supply. When half of the initial 2-month supply is used, the next 1-month supply may be ordered, and so on. Comment: In response to our specific request for comments on whether it is necessary to impose special storage requirements for safe-keeping of EPO, two commenters stated that storage and home safety issues need to be more specifically addressed and documented. They recommended that we require, as part of the assessment, assurance that the patient has the ability to store EPO under refrigeration, secure from tampering and out of the reach of children. Response: We agree with the commenters and have revised §405.2163(g) to add the suggested language. Comment: One commenter questioned whether HCFA will establish regional intermediaries to process home EPO claims. Response: EPO claims from home dialysis patients who obtain their dialysis supplies directly from suppliers will be processed by four regional carriers that were designated under a final rule published on June 18, 1992 (at 57 FR 27290), and that also process claims for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and other items covered under Medicare Part B. However, claims for items furnished incident to a physician's service as defined in 42 CFR 410.10(b) will continue to be processed under the current carrier configuration, and regional intermediaries will continue to process claims from facilities. Comment: One commenter stated that at least one 8-hour day should be allocated to train a patient in proper techniques of self-administration. The commenter also asked whether a training fee can be charged for this training time or whether any additional reimbursement can be obtained since this added monitoring activity expands physician activities under the monthly capitation plan. Response: We agree that patients need to be properly trained in the self-administration of EPO; however, we do not believe that we should set a specific minimum time limit for training as suggested by the commenter. We believe there should be sufficient flexibility to allow for differences in individual patients' learning ability. There is no separate payment for training or retraining in, and monitoring of, home use of EPO. A patient should be trained to self-administer EPO as part of the home dialysis training program that is paid for at the home dialysis training composite rate in accordance with §413.170 of the HCFA rules. With respect to monitoring self-administration of EPO, we believe the additional physician's time and effort are minimal and should be subsumed within the physician's monthly capitation payment under §414.314 of those rules. Comment: Two commenters asked whether reimbursement can be expected for home supplies needed to self-administer EPO, e.g., syringe, needle, alcohol wipes. Response: Payment for the medical supplies needed for administration of EPO, whether in the home or in a facility, is included in the Medicare payment rate for EPO. Both before OBRA '90 and since the implementation of those provisions, HCFA has always included the cost of supplies as part of the Medicare payment for EPO. We see no basis for different treatment of supplies for self-administration of EPO in the home. The payment rate for EPO is $11.00 per 1,000 units and, we believe, is more than adequate to cover the minimal cost of supplies (less than 20 cents per administration). The manufacturer of EPO is protected from competition for seven years by the Orphan Drug Act. The company reports substantial profits and gives rebates to facilities depending upon usage. It appears that facilities pay considerably less for EPO than the Medicare rate, providing sufficient payment for supplies needed for administration.

Summary: 
Text: The source of this information is the Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) study, ``Draft Report_Review of Epogen Reimbursement'' (Audit No. A-01-92-00506). The OIG reviewed invoices paid by dialysis facilities and financial reports filed by the manufacturer and found that facilities generally pay nine to ten percent less for EPO than the Medicare payment rate. In addition, the manufacturer gave surveyed facilities end-of-year rebates ranging from two percent to eight percent depending upon the volume of EPO used. Comment: Two commenters expressed the hope that local physicians will be able to continue to administer EPO incident to a physician's service. Response: This regulation is in no way intended to preclude provision of EPO furnished incident to a physician's service. Comment: One commenter was of the opinion that there is no statutory authority for the provision in §413.170(c)(6)) requiring suppliers to accept assignment of benefits for EPO. Response: The statutory provisions for payment of benefits for EPO are in section 1881(b)(1). Section 1881(b)(1)(B) of the Act provides for payments ``to or in behalf of'' beneficiaries for home dialysis supplies and equipment. However, with respect to payment for self-administered EPO, section 1881(b)(1)(C) permits payment only to a supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment that is not a provider of services, a renal dialysis facility, or a physician. There is no authority in the law to pay this benefit to a beneficiary. Therefore, the law implicitly requires payment to a supplier under assignment. Furthermore, any other reading of the statute would have anomalous results. For example, if the statute did not require suppliers to accept assignment, the beneficiary would be protected for charges for home dialysis supplies and equipment, but not for EPO furnished directly by the supplier. Nothing in the legislative history suggests the Congress intended such a result. V. Specific Changes to the Interim Final Rule. In response to the comments discussed above, we have made the following changes in the text of the interim final rule published on September 4, 1991. 1. Patient care plan. We have revised §405.2137(b)(7) to establish separate requirements for review of medication and evaluation of hematocrit for iron stores and to suggest use of a patient log for keeping the physician informed of the results of blood tests. 2. Patient selection. We have revised §405.2163 to_ •Require that the physician follow the drug labeling when he or she establishes the protocol and monitors home use of EPO; •Include as an assessment requirement obtaining assurance that EPO can be stored under refrigeration, secure from tampering and out of reach of children in the patient's residence. •Add a paragraph (h) to highlight the responsibilities of the physician and the dialysis facility and to make clear that the ``two-month'' supply of EPO is a maximum and that control of the amount ``on hand'' is maintained through the physician's prescriptions. B. Technical amendments. 1. Throughout the text ``Erythropoietin'' is changed to ``Epoetin'', which is the generic name of the drug. 2. In §413.170(c)(6), the cross-reference is corrected.

Summary: 
Text: VI. Regulatory Impact Statement A. Executive Order 12866 Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866) requires us to prepare an analysis for any document that meets one of the E.O. 12866 criteria for a ``significant regulatory action''; that is, that may_ •Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; •Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; •Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or •Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in E.O. 12866. In the proposed rule, we determined that a regulatory impact analysis was not required for these rules because they would not have an annual impact of $100 million or more or meet any of the other threshold criteria. However, we indicated our intention to include in the final rule a cost and benefit analysis that considers the social benefits to Medicare beneficiaries who use EPO at home. We asked for specific comments concerning benefits from home administration of EPO. We listed, as examples of these benefits, savings in travel and transportation costs previously required to obtain EPO or the ability of the beneficiary to resume employment. We also requested public comment on any benefits and costs that may be anticipated as a result of this regulation. No comments were received concerning the benefits of self-administration of EPO or on any portion of the impact analysis. Thus, we have prepared an analysis based on our review of data available to us and of pertinent literature. The following chart summarizes home dialysis beneficiary records for the period February 28, 1991 through February 29, 1992. It reflects the most current data on file and also encompasses the time immediately before and after July 1, 1991, the effective data of coverage of home administration of EPO. We identified, as ESRD beneficiaries who are potentially eligible for home use of EPO, beneficiaries who have completed the necessary home dialysis training or were home dialysis patients during this period. The chart indicates the number of beneficiaries on home dialysis and the number receiving EPO therapy as of June 30, 1991. The same information is shown for the billing period November 1, 1991 through January 31, 1992, the most current billing information for home dialysis beneficiaries. Home Dialysis Beneficiaries [February 28, 1991-February 29, 1992] 1 1Home Dialysis Beneficiaries 1Self-Adm.* 1Fac/Phy.** 1Not Receiv'g EPO As of 6/30/91 38,515 12,733 25,782 Billing Period 11/1/91-1/31/92 38,515 1,656 11,890 24,969 *Self-Adm. stands for self-administered. **Fac/Phy. stands for facility or physician administered. Our records indicate that as of June 30, 1991 there were 38,515 beneficiaries that dialyzed at home. Before coverage of home administration of EPO, 12,733 of these beneficiaries received EPO in the ESRD facility or in a physician's office. As a result of coverage of home administration of EPO, 1,656 beneficiaries or 4.3 percent of home dialysis beneficiaries self-administer EPO. We estimate that this number will increase as more beneficiaries become qualified to self-administer EPO and realize the benefits of home administration. In attempting to perform a cost-benefit analysis, we reviewed three published reports and one unpublished report. We also relied upon billing information submitted by intermediaries. Average expenditure for ESRD beneficiaries receiving EPO therapy approximate $6,900 exclusive of dialysis treatment. This amount includes the cost of the drug and other services such as iron treatment and hypertension therapy. The average annual cost for patients not using EPO approximates $450, exclusive of dialysis treatments, and includes the cost of other services such as blood transfusions and hepatitis therapy. The annual expenditures for EPO users represent very gross estimates. More definitive cost data and experience with the administration of EPO is needed in order to permit analysis of actual costs and EPO's relative effects. As mentioned earlier in this preamble, use of EPO by chronic renal failure patients reduces or eliminates the need for blood transfusions. EPO also reduces the recipients' risk of transfusion-related illnesses. The transmission of non-A, non-B hepatitis is of greatest concern (see ``Recombinant Human Erythropoietin: Factors to Consider in Cost-Benefit Analysis'', American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol. XVII, No. 1, January 1991). Although rare, the threat of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hepatitis B should also be considered. For ESRD patients receiving EPO, the risk of hepatitis infection related to transfusions has been reduced from 13.8 to 4.5 percent because the patient's need for blood transfusions has been reduced and in some cases eliminated.

Summary: 
Text: Reducing the need for transfusions also increases kidney transplant success in chronic renal failure patients by reducing sensitization. According to the above cited article, some individuals receiving frequent transfusions may develop cytotoxic antibodies. Excessive cytotoxity levels may result in increased waiting time for suitable organs. Also, when high cytotoxity levels are present, graft survival rates are reduced. When EPO is used, thus reducing or eliminating the need for transfusions, patients are more likely to retain transplanted organs successfully. There are other potential benefits associated with the use of EPO. Since EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells thereby reducing or eliminating anemia, the need for hospitalization due to anemia or anemia-related illnesses could be expected to decline. Another very important though not quantifiable benefit of receiving EPO is improved quality of life. An article appearing in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) (The Quality of Life of Hemodialysis Recipients Treated with Recombinant Human Erythropoietin, Vol. 263, No. 6, February 9, 1990) reported on the results of a study of over 300 hemodialysis patients in nine dialysis centers. The study showed that hemodialysis patients receiving EPO are happier_their energy levels are higher, physical functioning is improved, physical activity levels are increased, etc. Similar results were also reported in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases article mentioned earlier in this impact statement. Although these studies did not specifically study home dialysis patients, we believe that results would be equally true for this group. In reviewing the literature on EPO, we also found that most EPO recipients require additional medications or therapies to counteract possible adverse effects. Some of the possible side effects of EPO therapy are iron depletion, hypertension, and arteriovenous graft clotting. Iron Depletion_EPO recipients may not get the full benefit of increased hematocrits from EPO if they lack sufficient iron reserves. EPO increases the body's production of red blood cells. This requires sufficient iron reserves. Consequently, patients on EPO may become iron deficient. Their iron reserves must be monitored and iron supplements administered to ensure that the patient's iron reserves are not depleted. Hypertension_Use of EPO may elevate a patient's blood pressure, a reaction that may be related to the rate of increase in hematocrit. Therefore, an EPO patient's blood pressure must be carefully monitored. Thirty percent of all EPO patients receive hypertension therapy. Arteriovenous (AV) Graft Clotting_Fourteen percent of all EPO patients experience clotting of AV graft as compared to 6 percent of chronic renal patients not receiving EPO. The cause of the AV clotting is believed due to increased hematocrit. The foregoing benefits and adverse effects of using EPO are the same for patients who receive the drug in a physician's office or ESRD facility as for patients who self-administer the drug. Those beneficiaries who received EPO in a physician's office or ESRD facility and, as a result of this regulation, shift to self-administration will realize further benefits, such as savings of time and in transportation costs. In order to receive the full benefit of EPO therapy, most patients receive it at least three times a week. Therefore, we estimate that the savings in transportation costs will average approximately $300 per beneficiary for calendar year 1992. Of course, this estimate is only an average; the actual saving will vary depending on distance traveled to and from the ESRD facility or physician's office by a particular beneficiary. Since EPO is a relatively new drug, definitive information on its large scale effectiveness, direct costs, savings, etc., is not available. Literature supports the view that ESRD beneficiaries receiving EPO experience an improved quality of life, resulting in higher energy levels and improved physical functioning. For those beneficiaries who did receive EPO in a physician's office or ESRD facility and meet the criteria for self-administration, the change to self-administration will save time and eliminate travel expenses associated with office and facility visits. We expect that over time more home dialysis beneficiaries who did not receive EPO or received a reduced dosage because they were unable to travel to the physician's office or ESRD facility as often as needed will become candidates for self-administration of EPO. We do not have data on which to base a prediction of the number who will choose this form of administration. Obviously, each beneficiary's physician will need to consider potential adverse as well as beneficial effects. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 602 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, individuals are not considered to be small entities. Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. We are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Paperwork Reduction Act Section 405.2137 of this rule contains information collection requirements that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. When OMB approves these provisions, we will publish a Federal Register notice to that effect. If you comment on the information collection requirements, please send a copy of those comments directly to: Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Allison Herron Eydt, Desk Officer for HCFA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: First Report and Order Adopted: January 4, 1994; Released: January 5, 1994. By the Commission: I. Introduction 1. On September 23, 1993, we adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) 1 in which we proposed, inter alia, to establish a procedure by which private land mobile radio licensees that will be reclassified as commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers pursuant to this rule making proceeding could file a waiver petition to retain existing foreign ownership. We now establish the filing procedure for these waiver petitions and remind all potentially affected licensees of the February 10, 1994, filing deadline. We also emphasize that filing such a petition will not prejudice the licensee's right at a later date to assert that it should not be classified as a CMRS provider. 1 GN Docket No. 93-252, 8 FCC Rcd 7988, 8002-03 ¶¶ 76-78 (1993), 58 FR 53169 (October 14, 1993). II. Background 2. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act) 2 amended sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 153(n), 332 (Communications Act), to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services. ``[A]ny provider of a private land mobile service that will be treated as a common carrier as a result of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993'' is subject to the foreign ownership restrictions imposed on common carriers by section 310(b) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 310(b). 3 Nevertheless, the statute allows affected licensees to petition the Commission for waiver of the application of section 310(b) to any foreign ownership that lawfully existed as of May 24, 1993. The statute requires that these petitions for waiver be filed with the Commission by February 10, 1994 (within 6 months of enactment of the Budget Act). The Commission may grant such waivers to eligible petitioners only upon the following conditions: 2 Pub. L. No. 103-66, Title VI, §6002(b), 107 Stat. 312, 392, 395 (1993); see H.R. Conf. Rep.

Section 310(b) states in relevant part: No * * * common carrier * * * license shall be granted to or held by_ (1) any alien or the representative of any alien; (2) any corporation organized under the laws of any foreign government; (3) any corporation of which any officer or director is an alien or of which more than one-fifth of the capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens or their representatives or by a foreign government or representative thereof or by any corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country; (4) any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which any officer or more than one-fourth of the directors are aliens, or of which more than one-fourth of the capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens, their representatives, or by a foreign government or representative thereof, or by any corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country, if the Commission finds that the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license. For the purposes of section 310(b), certain partnership interests, as well as certain other interests held by non-corporate entities and associations, may be considered ownership interests. 5 5 See e.g. , Wilner & Scheiner, 103 FCC 2d 511 (1985), reconsideration granted in part, 1 FCC Rcd 12 (1986); see also Moving Phones Partnership, L.P. v. FCC, 998 F.2d 1051, 1055-57 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Section 310(b) was amended in 1974 to eliminate the restriction on alien ownership of private radio licensees. Pub. L. 93-505, 88 Stat 1576; H.R. Report No. 93-1423, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1974 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 6305, 6307. However, the ban on licensing radio facilities to foreign governments or representatives, established in section 310(a), still applies to all licensees.

Summary: 
Text: 4. The Notice proposed to establish a petition procedure to allow licensees to ``grandfather'' their foreign ownership. Under this procedure, petitioners would be required to (1) identify all foreign persons or entities holding an interest in the licensee and the percentage of ownership interest for each; and (2) certify that the identity and level of foreign ownership are unchanged since May 24, 1993, and that no change will occur in the future (other than divestiture of a foreign ownership interest to a domestic person or entity) without prior notice to the Commission. 6 6 Notice, 8 FCC Rcd at 8002-03 ¶77. 5. The Notice indicated that we intend to place the burden on licensees to file petitions, regardless of whether we have made a final determination as to whether the licensee is subject to reclassification as a CMRS provider. Furthermore, the Notice stated that while the filing of a petition would not prejudice a licensee's future arguments as to whether it should be reclassified, licensees who failed to file a timely petition would be subject to immediate enforcement of our foreign ownership restrictions. 7 7 Id. at 8003 ¶78. III. Comments 6. A single commenter responded to this issue. Roamer One, Inc., argues that the Notice misread the Budget Act's amendment to the Communications Act to the extent that it imposes ``immediate'' foreign ownership restrictions on all private radio licensees. 8 It maintains that while the Notice refers to private land mobile service providers that ``may'' be treated as common carriers, the statute refers to existing private land mobile service providers that ``will'' be treated as common carriers as a result of the enactment of the Budget Act. 9 It contends that, prior to the completion of this rule making proceeding, the Commission may not impose alien ownership restrictions on private radio licensees who are unlikely to be classified as CMRS providers. 10 8 Comments of Roamer One, Inc., at 15-16 (Nov. 8, 1993); see also id. at iii-iv. 9 Id. at 15. 10 Id. IV. Discussion A. Who Should File a Waiver Petition 7. Initially, we agree with Roamer One that Section 332(c)(6) does not impose foreign ownership restrictions on all private radio licensees. As noted above, the foreign ownership restrictions apply only to those current private land mobile service providers that ``will be'' classified as CMRS providers ``as a result of enactment of the [Budget Act].'' As we discussed in the Notice, a private land mobile radio licensee could potentially be reclassified as a CMRS licensee if it meets two criteria: Its service: (1) Is ``provided for profit,'' and (2) makes ``interconnected service'' available ``to the public'' or ``to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public.'' In addition, it is possible that a service might not fully satisfy the two criteria, but nonetheless be classified as CMRS if the Commission were to find that the service is the ``functional equivalent'' of CMRS. 11 If a licensee determines that there is a possibility that it will be reclassified as a CMRS provider, it must also determine whether its foreign ownership as of May 24, 1993, would be prohibited under section 310(b). 12 11 See Notice, 8 FCC Rcd at 7990-96 ¶¶10-40. 12 See paragraph 3, supra.

Summary: 
Text: 8. Final rules governing regulatory classification of mobile services may not be available on or before the February 10, 1994, filing deadline. We recognize that this presents private land mobile licensees with the potentially difficult decision of whether they should file petitions for waiver. Therefore, in instances where there is any chance at all that the licensee might later be classified as a CMRS provider, we strongly encourage the licensee to err on the side of filing and thereby preserve all of its rights under the new statutory provisions. Similarly, if a licensee is uncertain of whether it would be affected by section 310(b) restrictions absent a waiver, we strongly recommend that the licensee file a petition. B. Contents of Waiver Petition 9. As noted above, section 332(c)(6) permits the Commission to grant waiver petitions only where two conditions are met. First, the waiver can only cover ``the [licensee's] extent of foreign ownership interest [that has] not * * * increased above the extent which existed on May 24, 1993.'' Consistent with the legislative history quoted previously (see note 4, supra), we interpret this language to refer to the precise identities of persons or entities and not merely to preexisting levels of foreign ownership interests. Petitioners must therefore identify in their petitions all foreign interests in the licensee as of May 24, 1993, that would, absent a waiver, be subject to the section 310(b) restrictions and for which a waiver is sought. For instance, except as noted below, petitioners should specifically identify all foreign persons or entities holding an ownership interest in the licensee and the percentage of ownership interest of each and identify all foreign partners, 13 officers, and directors, regardless of whether they have any ownership interest. While we will not require publicly traded corporations 14 to identify each foreign stockholder in instances where this requirement would be especially onerous, 15 we note that it is the responsibility of all petitioners to ensure that all foreign ownership listed in the petition, including that held by individual stockholders, did exist as of May 24, 1993, and to retain documentation substantiating that ownership. 13 Petitioners must list all foreign partners regardless of whether they are general or limited partners, except that petitioners need not list a limited partner (1) whose level of ownership interest in the licensee does not exceed the level allowed by section 310(b), and (2) who is ``insulated'' from the management and control of the partnership. See, e.g., Wilner and Scheiner, supra, 103 FCC 2d at 517 n. 31, 520 n. 43; Attribution of Ownership Interests, Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 83-46, 58 RR 2d 604, 619-20 ¶¶48-50 (1985). 14 For a definition of such corporations, see First Report and Order and Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration in CC Docket Nos. 90-6, 85-388, 6 FCC Rcd 6185, 6213 ¶63 (1991). 15 See, e.g., Advanced Mobile Phone Inc., 54 RR 2d 354, 362 ¶29 (Com. Car. Bur. 1983) (applicant demonstrated sufficient compliance with the requirements of FCC Form 401 by indicating the percentage of its common stock held or voted by aliens, and by listing the identities of its ten largest stockholders and stating that none of them was an alien, and would not be required to circulate a questionnaire to all of its stockholders). The burden will be on any entity claiming such an onerous burden to explain why identifying individual shareholders would be extraordinarily burdensome. 10. The second condition is that the waiver cannot permit any ``subsequent transfer of ownership to any other person in violation of section 310(b).'' We interpret ``subsequent'' here to mean subsequent to May 24, 1993. Petitioners must therefore certify in their petitions that the identity and percentages of each listed component of foreign ownership are unchanged since May 24, 1993, and that each listed foreign officer, director or partner continues to hold the same position. The waiver can recognize only the particular person or entity that held the ownership interest on May 24, 1993; it cannot recognize any subsequent transfers to other foreign owners or foreign officers or directors. 16 If, following the grant of a waiver in light of the above condition, a licensee wishes to transfer ``grandfathered'' foreign ownership interests, the waiver will remain valid (for the remaining ``grandfathered'' interests) only if the transfer is made to a domestic person or entity. 17 The same is true for ``grandfathered'' partners, officers, and directors. 16 See note 4, supra. Thus, transfers to aliens that occurred after May 24 are not covered by the grandfathering provisions of the Budget Act even if they occurred before the Budget Act was enacted on August 10, 1993. Where such a transfer is found to create an ownership interest in violation of section 310(b), the licensee will be required to comply with section 310(b) with respect to that interest, regardless of whether alien ownership in the licensee that existed prior to May 24 is grandfathered. 17 Licensees seeking to transfer their ownership or control would also be required to comply with section 310(d) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 310(d), and with applicable Commission rules.

Summary: 
Text: C. Effective Date of Section 310(b) Restrictions 11. Roamer One appears to object to our statement in the Notice that ``all reclassifiable private licensees are immediately subject to the foreign ownership restrictions on common carriers by section 310(b).'' 18 As noted above, Roamer One contends that, prior to the completion of this rule making proceeding, the Commission should not impose alien ownership restrictions on private radio licensees who are unlikely to be classified as CMRS providers. We agree that the restrictions in section 310(b) would only apply to licensees that are actually reclassified pursuant to the statute and its implementation in this rule making. Section 310(b) does not and will not apply to private land mobile radio licensees who will not be reclassified as CMRS providers. On the other hand, the statute does require immediate enforcement of section 310(b) for private land mobile providers that are reclassified as CMRS. Section 6002(c)(2)(B) of the Budget Act states: 18 Notice, 8 FCC Rcd at 8002 ¶ 76 (emphasis added). [A]ny private land mobile service provided by any person before [the Budget Act's] date of enactment, and any paging service utilizing frequencies allocated as of January 1, 1993, for private land mobile services, shall, except for purposes of section 332(c)(6) of [the Communications Act], be treated as a private mobile service until 3 years after such date of enactment. Budget Act, section 6002(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Although other common carrier regulation may not apply to some licensees for 3 years, unless a licensee timely files and is granted a waiver pursuant to section 332(c)(6), section 310(b) will apply immediately upon the effective date of our rules reclassifying the licensee's service as CMRS. Accordingly, as stated above, licensees that may be reclassified should file a timely waiver request to grandfather any foreign ownership or other interest that existed as of May 24, 1993, and that might be affected by the application of section 310(b). V. Petitioning Procedure 12. In light of the above, we adopt the following petitioning procedure. First, petitions should be in an informal, letter format, and must contain the caption ``COMMERCIAL MOBILE RADIO SERVICE FOREIGN OWNERSHIP WAIVER PETITION.'' Petitions must clearly specify the licensee's name, radio service, call sign(s), station address(es) or geographical location(s), and contact person with telephone number. Petitions must specifically request a waiver of section 310(b), identify the particular subsection(s) of section 310(b) for which the waiver is requested, and state that the waiver is sought under section 332(c)(6). The original copy of the waiver petition must be signed by the licensee, 19 and this signature will be taken to certify that all statements made in the petition are true, complete, correct, and made in good faith. 19 See Section 1.913 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.913. 13. In addition, as proposed in the Notice, petitions must:

Summary: 
Text: (1) identify by name, 20 as of May 24, 1993, all foreign persons or other entities holding ownership interests in the licensee, directly or indirectly, that would, absent a waiver, not be permitted to hold such interests under section 310(b), and for which a waiver is sought; likewise, petitions must identify similarly situated foreign partners, officers, or directors of the licensee, regardless of whether they have any ownership interest in the licensee; 20 As noted previously, publicly traded corporations are not required to identify all individual stockholders when to do so would constitute an especially onerous burden. See notes 14-15, supra, and accompanying text. (2) as applicable, as of May 24, 1993, identify the following for each person or other entity (including officers, directors and partners) identified in (1) above: residence, citizenship, office or directorship held, number of shares or nature of partnership interests, number of votes, and percentage of votes; also, if the entity is other than an individual, petitions must also identify the name, address, and citizenship of the natural person authorized to vote the stock; and (3) Answer the following: (a) Have the ownership and other interests listed pursuant to (1) and (2) above remained the same since May 24, 1993? (b) Have the officers, directors or partners continued to retain their positions since May 24, 1993? If the answer to (a) or (b) is ``No,'' please explain. 14. Petitioners must also certify that, in the case of an individual petitioner, he or she is not subject to a denial of federal benefits, that includes FCC benefits, pursuant to section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 21 U.S.C. section 862, or, in the case of a non-individual petitioner, (e.g., corporation, partnership, or other unincorporated association), no party to the application is subject to a denial of federal benefits, that includes FCC benefits, pursuant to that section. For the definition of a ``party'' for these purposes, see 47 CFR 1.2002(b). 15. The Commission has no authority to extend the Congressionally mandated deadline date, so it is imperative that waiver petitions be filed on time. To be timely received, petitions must, by February 10, 1994, be either (1) hand-delivered to the offices of the FCC in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, at the address below, or (2) received through the U.S. Mail or other mail delivery service at the address below. Federal Communications Commission, Attn: CMRS Foreign Ownership Waiver Petition, 1270 Fairfield Road, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania 17325_7245. Licensees should file one original and two copies. These petitions do not require a filing fee. VI. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 16. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 604, the Commission's final analysis is as follows: A. Need for, and Purpose of, This Action As a result of recent legislation, certain private land mobile radio licensees will be reclassified as commercial mobile radio service licensees and will be subject to foreign ownership restrictions within the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. This present First Report and Order describes the procedure by which such licensees may file a waiver petition with the Commission to request retention of existing foreign ownership that would otherwise not be permitted. B. Summary of the Issues Raised by the Public Comments in Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis In regard to the foreign ownership issue addressed by this First Report and Order, no comments were submitted in response to our Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. C. Significant Alternatives Considered No significant alternatives were considered. VII. Ordering Clauses 17. Accordingly, It is Ordered That, pursuant to the authority of sections 4(i), 303(r), and 332(c)(6) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 303(r), and 332(c)(6), this First Report and Order is adopted, effective upon publication in the Federal Register . 21 21 In light of the statutory deadline for filing petitions, we find that there is good cause to make this action effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register . 18.

Summary: The Director of Defense Procurement is issuing an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to integrate Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program waivers necessitated by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act with similar existing Department of Defense waivers for countries with memoranda of understanding or other international agreements.
Text: DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Parts 225 and 252 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). ACTION: Interim rule with request for public comments. SUMMARY: The Director of Defense Procurement is issuing an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to integrate Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program waivers necessitated by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act with similar existing Department of Defense waivers for countries with memoranda of understanding or other international agreements. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Alyce Sullivan, (703) 697-7266. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Chapter Ten of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act of 1993 requires the United States, Canada, and Mexico to eliminate ``buy national'' restrictions on non-defense related purchases by the federal governments. NAFTA is being implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation but also requires revision of the DFARS to integrate Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program waivers necessitated by NAFTA with similar existing Department of Defense waivers for countries with memoranda of understanding or other international agreements. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The interim rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the rule waives the Buy American Act for certain Mexican and Canadian products. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy for the Small Business Administration. Comments are invited. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 93-610 in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act applies because the provisions at 252.225-7006, Buy American Act-Trade Agreements-Balance of Payments Program Certificate, and 252.225-7035, Buy American Act-North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act-Balance of Payments Program Certificate, require offerors to list the line item number and country of origin for any end product other than a domestic end product. Accordingly, a request for clearance of a new information collection requirement concerning the North American Free Trade Agreement Act is being submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule. Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment. This action is necessary because the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, signed into law on December 8, 1993, becomes effective on January 1, 1994. However, pursuant to Public Law 98-577 and Federal Acquisition Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response to this interim rule will be considered in formulating the final rule.

ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends existing regulations that govern the State-Administered Workplace Literacy Program and the National Workplace Literacy Program. These amendments are needed to increase project accountability and to make technical changes. The regulations provide rules for applying for and expending Federal funds under these programs. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Sarah E. Newcomb, Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., room 4417, Mary E. Switzer Building, Washington, DC 20202-7320. Telephone: (202) 205-9872. Or Ms. Jeanne Williams, Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., room 4518, Mary E. Switzer Building, Washington, DC 20202-7327. Telephone: (202) 205-5977. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1-800-877-8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The State-Administered Workplace Literacy Program and the National Workplace Literacy Program are important activities that assist in achieving the National Education Goals. Specifically, the workplace literacy programs address Goal 5, that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Moreover, the National Workplace Literacy Program supports this goal by providing grants to exemplary partnerships between a business, industry, or labor organization, or a private industry council, and an education organization to support work-related literacy education. These regulations increase the accountability of workplace literacy projects. The Department is implementing this strategy in order to expand the demonstration and dissemination activities of projects, thereby increasing the number of instructional approaches, materials, and techniques for providing work-related literacy education that are submitted to and approved by the Department's Program Effectiveness Panel, and subsequently made available to practitioners.

Summary: 
Text: On May 27, 1993, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for these programs in the Federal Register (58 FR 30916). Analysis of Comments and Changes In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 33 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Issues are grouped according to subject, with appropriate sections of the regulations referenced in parentheses. Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority and comments on subjects outside the scope of these regulations_are not addressed. PART 462_STATE-ADMINISTERED WORKPLACE LITERACY PROGRAM Partnership Agreement (§§462.30(c) and 462.32(b)) Comments: Some commenters were concerned that requiring partners to enter into a binding agreement would have a dampening effect on businesses joining partnerships, and recommended a less restrictive approach. Another commenter supported requiring a binding agreement. Discussion: For five years the Secretary has required, under the National Workplace Literacy Program, the types of binding agreements that would become part of the State-Administered program. The Secretary's experience is that these agreements are essential to eliciting quality applications, promoting project success, and ensuring accountable grant performance. Changes : None. PART 472_NATIONAL WORKPLACE LITERACY PROGRAM Definitions_Employment and Training Agency (§472.5) Comments: One commenter mistakenly thought the proposed change, which would clarify that employment and training agencies are nonprofit agencies, would exclude from participation as partners profit-making organizations that provide employment and training services. Other commenters agreed with the proposed change to the definition of ``employment and training agency.'' Discussion: The proposed change would codify an existing program practice that requires an education partner classified as an employment and training agency to be a nonprofit entity. However, profit-makers can continue to participate as partners under the classification ``business'' or ``industry'' organization. See §472.2(a)(1). Profit-making organizations should note that a selection criterion in §472.22(c)(4) requests applications to indicate the extent to which training will be provided through the education partner classified under §472.2(a)(2), rather than through the business or labor partner classified under §472.2(a)(1), unless transferring this activity to the business or labor partner is necessary and reasonable within the framework of the applicant's proposed project. Changes : None. Project Director (§§472.5 and 472.32(e)) Comments: Several commenters supported the regulations defining the term ``project director'' and requiring that each project provide for a director. Some of these commenters recommended additional regulations, including requiring a full-time project director, specifying the qualifications of a project director, and requiring that proposed personnel demonstrate substantive experience, education, and training in the workplace. Discussion: Because the project director will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the project, the qualifications of that person should be directly related to the specific requirements of the project, and will naturally differ somewhat from project to project. The Secretary strongly encourages applicants to hire project directors with experience and training in project management and in fields related to objectives of the project, but believes that a list of standardized qualifications would limit the discretion of applicant partnerships to hire directors who respond to the needs of the project. The regulations do not specifically require a full-time project director, and this may not be needed_especially in small projects. However, each project must provide for a director who will devote sufficient time to exercising day-to-day operational responsibility and ensure that the project is well managed. Changes : None. Preapplications (§§472.10 and 472.11) Comment: One commenter suggested retaining §§472.10 and 472.11, which describe a preapplication process, because the process would save time for projects that might not be appropriate for a national competition. Another commenter supported the Department's proposal to delete these sections because a preapplication would be a burdensome paperwork requirement. Discussion: Historically, these sections were included in the regulations to authorize use of a preapplication process where it would be helpful to applicants. However, the provision has never been needed, and the Department does not foresee its use in the future. Changes: None. Preference for Small Business Partners (§472.21(e)) Comments: One commenter agreed that preference points should be given for applications involving a small business, but thought that the points should be given even if the business is not involved as a project partner. The commenter stated that it is unrealistic to expect small businesses to become partners because this would burden them with paperwork, meetings, and unnecessary reports. Another commenter suggested giving an additional preference to partnerships involving small businesses with less than 100 or 250 employees. Discussion: A small business can potentially be involved in a workplace literacy project as a ``partner,'' a ``contractor,'' a ``helping organization,'' or a ``site.'' Each of these terms is defined in 34 CFR 472.5, which clarifies that only a partner can receive program funds and be fully involved in project policy and operations. The Secretary believes that preference should be given only to those partnerships that include small businesses as partners. To interpret the preference more broadly would benefit applications that involve large businesses as partners_and merely involve small businesses in a less significant role. Each partnership agreement designates one of the partners to serve as the project grantee. This partner is principally responsible for project administration, including paperwork and reports. Any small business partner that does not wish to serve as a grantee can enter into an agreement designating another partner as the grantee, and can thus avoid the paperwork burden. The Secretary has adopted a definition of the term ``small business'' modeled on regulations of the Small Business Administration and does not believe it would be beneficial to modify that definition by giving an additional preference to small businesses having particularly small numbers of employees.

Summary: 
Text: Changes: None. Selection Criteria_Program Factors (§472.22(a)(5)) Comment: Section 472.22(a)(5) proposed adding language to a selection criterion encouraging applicants to focus ``on improving performance in jobs or job functions that have a broad representation within the Nation's workforce so that the products can be adapted for use by similar workplaces across the Nation.'' Several commenters interpreted this language as a statement of the scope of services that are allowable under the National Workplace Literacy Program, believed that this scope had been defined too narrowly, and urged that it be expanded to include a variety of activities. It was also suggested that a project be permitted to provide any services identified in a needs assessment. One commenter asked whether use of the term ``jobs or job functions'' was intended to shift focus away from job-specific competencies of current job titles to broader competencies that are identified in the report issued by the Department of Labor Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS). The commenter asked that the Department clarify or define which jobs or job functions have ``broad representation within the Nation's workforce.'' Other commenters stated that a broader scope of services is needed to meet the National Education Goals. Discussion: Section 472.22(a)(5) is a selection criterion used to evaluate applications and is not a statement of the scope of allowable program services. That scope is stated in §472.3, which reflects sections 371(a)(1) and (3) of the Adult Education Act, and lists allowable activities. Many activities mentioned by the commenters, such as speaking, listening, reasoning, problem-solving, team building, GED preparation, and meeting the literacy needs of adults with limited English proficiency, are allowable under §472.3. Further guidance on the scope of allowable activities is included in the notice inviting applications published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . Generally, workplace literacy projects teach literacy skills needed in the workplace that improve the productivity of the workforce. The program is not a program of general adult education and cannot serve needs that are not directly related to the workplace. At the same time, projects serving needs that are directly related to the workplace are encouraged to use creative approaches to stimulate workers' interests and to develop individualized education plans that reflect workers' goals. See §472.22(c)(2). The purpose of the language encouraging a focus on nationally representative jobs or job functions is to enhance the capability of a project to demonstrate results that can be adapted by similar employers and industries. Section 472.22(a)(5) was not proposed specifically to respond to the recommendations of the SCANS report, nor was the report intended to modify the scope of services under the workplace literacy program. The Secretary believes that it is unnecessary to define by regulation what jobs or job functions are broadly representative. Applicants are encouraged to make their own evaluation of current and future labor market conditions, and design a project that can help similar workplaces in the future. This should assist in meeting National Education Goal 5, that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Changes: None. Selection Criteria_Demonstration (§472.22(h)) (Proposed §472.22(h)(1)) Comments: Several commenters agreed that the Department should emphasize dissemination activities, and recommended the inclusion of various other dissemination strategies. Two commenters were concerned that dissemination activities could be hampered because the instructional materials produced by a project might contain protected information. One commenter suggested that, because carrying out both the demonstration and commitment activities described in proposed §472.22(h)(1) and (2) would be overwhelming, applicants should be asked to address only one of these criteria. Discussion: The dissemination strategies listed in proposed §472.22(h)(1) are among the regulatory changes designed to transform the National Workplace Literacy Program into a true demonstration program. See the previous discussion of the background of these regulations and note also §472.31(c), which requires that a project be independently evaluated for ``spread'' and ``transportability'' to other sites. Proposed §472.22(h)(1) encouraged applicants to use certain dissemination strategies but was not intended to preclude the use of additional strategies when they are appropriate for a particular project. The Secretary does not expect or anticipate that partnerships will disseminate trade secrets or other protected information. However, a project's dissemination activities should clearly benefit businesses and workplaces outside of the partnership. While, ideally, all partners will be involved in demonstration and commitment activities, these activities may be accomplished through the efforts of particular partners. The Secretary desires that the factors listed in the criteria on ``Demonstration'' and ``Commitment'' be reflected in an applicant's program design, management plan, and budget. However, the Secretary does not anticipate that addressing both criteria will be burdensome if partners adequately plan and budget for them. Changes: The selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed §472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in §472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in §472.22(i). Also see the discussion on §472.22(i). Selection Criteria_Commitment (§472.22(i)) (Proposed §472.22(h)(2))

Summary: 
Text: Comments: Several commenters opposed the criterion that encouraged applicants to state how partners plan to establish a program of workplace literacy services that can continue after Federal funding ends. Many of these commenters believed this criterion would adversely affect small businesses since they might not have the resources needed to continue a workplace literacy project. Other commenters pointed out that some businesses, especially small businesses, have short-term training needs that can be met during the course of the project and, therefore, would not need to continue the project. Still other commenters thought that because small businesses would not be able to continue a project, this criterion would nullify the five-point preference given for partnerships that include a small business. Some commenters supported the inclusion of the criterion on commitment and indicated past success with this concept, but suggested that small businesses be exempted. Other commenters believed that expecting business partners to make a commitment to continue a project that is unproven is unreasonable and could scare away potential business partners. These commenters thought that commitment is best sought and obtained during a successful project. Some commenters suggested such alternative methods of demonstrating commitment as release time for assessment and training, strategic planning for capacity-building, training business partners to provide workplace literacy, active participation of all partners, or gradual assumption of costs. Discussion: The Secretary acknowledges the many helpful comments on this topic. Although proposed §472.22(h)(2) did not involve a commitment to any unforeseeable or unnecessary post-project activities, the Secretary wishes to avoid any implication that this is the case. The Secretary also desires to preserve the competitive preference for partnerships involving small businesses. Accordingly, the selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed §472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in §472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in §472.22(i). Moreover, §472.22(i) makes it clear that plans for continuing workplace literacy after Federal funding ends should be based on realistic forecasts of the literacy needs of partners and should take into consideration a partner's capacity to continue services. To emphasize this point, the criterion now provides a range of examples of practical strategies for institutionalizing workplace literacy, many of which can be carried out by small businesses. The criterion also recognizes the importance of an applicant's commitment to institutionalizing learning in the workplace specifically during the project itself. These changes are intended to accommodate the legitimate concerns of the commenters while preserving the overall purpose of a selection criterion on commitment. The recently published study Adult Literacy in America points out that some 90 million adults demonstrate low levels of literacy and depicts a society in which the vast majority of Americans do not have the skills needed to earn a living in our increasingly technological society and international marketplace. The Secretary believes that a commitment to institutionalize learning will naturally lead to continuing efforts to promote workplace literacy after Federal funding ends and will assist in transforming American workplaces to meet the challenges of a world market. Changes: The selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed §472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in §472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in §472.22(i). The criterion on ``Commitment'' clarifies that applicants are to develop practical strategies for institutionalizing workplace literacy that are based on realistic forecasts of literacy needs and the capacity of partners. The criterion also encourages applicants to demonstrate a commitment to institutionalizing learning in the workplace during the project. Reporting (§472.30(b)) Comments: Numerous commenters expressed the view that a two-page semi-annual performance and financial report would not be overly burdensome. These commenters felt that the data would be a good planning tool, would help projects monitor their progress, and would contribute to the standardization of the workplace literacy program nationwide. Other commenters suggested that the reports be made available at the time of award so that data bases could be designed to facilitate collection. Some commenters strongly advocated quarterly reports that include, in addition to the information the Secretary proposed collecting, a brief update on the success of the project in achieving its objectives. Two commenters recommended annual reporting, one because of the project's cycle for collecting evaluative data and the other because of the possibility that the Department might not have adequate staff resources to use the performance and financial data as intended. Discussion: The Secretary considered requiring quarterly reports for the National Workplace Literacy Program, but determined that they would be burdensome for grantees. However, the Secretary believes that annual reports would not provide sufficient information to ensure program accountability and ready access to information that is comparable across projects. Grantees will be required to submit brief continuation applications annually in order to receive funding for the second and third year of their projects. The Secretary believes that the continuation application and a two-page semi-annual report on progress and total spending for the reporting period will be adequate. The reports will be made available to grantees at the start of their projects to enable them to set up appropriate recordkeeping procedures, and the Department will work with grantees to ensure that reports are used appropriately both to monitor and to improve projects. Changes: None. Evaluation (§472.31) Comments: Several commenters thought that the requirement for projects to have a third-party evaluator would be expensive, burdensome, or too costly. Several other commenters supported the evaluation requirement because a rigorous evaluation design is essential to demonstrating impact and replicable results and would strengthen projects. One commenter was concerned that tying student learning gains to higher job productivity and performance would not result in reliable or valid measures of the effectiveness of projects because learning gains are not the only conditions affecting these factors. Discussion: Program experience over the life of the National Workplace Literacy Program indicates that a third-party evaluation enhances the quality of a project without being expensive, burdensome, or too costly. The Secretary agrees with the comment that multiple conditions, including learning gains, may contribute to measured improvements in job productivity and performance. This comment supports the need for a rigorous evaluation design that includes, insofar as possible, controls for other variables that may also contribute to the improvements measured. Evaluations of this rigor require highly trained research and evaluation personnel who cannot always be found among staff persons employed within funded projects. Changes: None. Start-up Period (§472.32(b)) Comments: Numerous commenters supported lengthening the grant period to three years and extending the start-up period. However, one commenter questioned the necessity of a six-month start-up period. Discussion: The heightened emphasis on demonstration and dissemination activities requires lengthening the grant period to three years, and, as necessary, lengthening the time needed to establish a project before services are provided to adult workers. Although §472.32(b)(1) permits applicants to take up to a six-month start-up period, §472.32(b)(2) requires applicants to ``minimize the start-up period, if any, proposed for their projects.'' Changes: None. Continuation of a Project After a Partner Withdraws (§472.34) Comments: One commenter suggested that the regulations specifically apply to business partners. Another commenter thought the regulations favored projects with more than two partners, and requested greater flexibility in the renegotiation of the scope of work of a grant. A commenter suggested that a project be allowed to continue despite the withdrawal of a partner, even if the conditions of §472.34 are not satisfied. One commenter inquired whether all, or only one, of the conditions outlined in §472.34 must be met by withdrawing partners. Discussion: Although each partnership is required to designate one partner as its applicant and grantee, an award is made on the basis of the partnership agreement that is signed by all members of the partnership and that binds the partners to every statement and assurance made in the application, in addition to carrying out their respective roles. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the approved scope of work will continue to be carried out if a partner withdraws, regardless of the type of partner withdrawing or the number of partners in the original partnership. The regulations do not favor projects with more than two partners. Section 472.34(b)(1) allows for the full substitution of a partner even in the case of a two-party partnership so long as the partnership continues to meet the requirement in §472.2(b) that there be at least one education partner and one business or labor partner. The Secretary wishes to point out that the conditions in §472.34 are to be met by the remaining partners. They are not conditions to be met by the withdrawing partners as suggested by the commenter. Moreover, all of the conditions described in §472.34 must be met before the Secretary will allow a project to continue.

Summary: 
Text: Changes: Section 472.34 has been changed to clarify that all of the conditions described in this section must be met if a project is to be allowed to continue after the withdrawal of a partner. Union and Worker Involvement (Part 472) Comments: Several commenters thought unions should be involved in the development and implementation of projects. Some of these commenters recommended requiring a written statement indicating consultation with and concurrence by the union. Others suggested requiring a statement from the union that it either agrees to full partnership with the education partner and business partner or it acknowledges the collaboration between the education and business partner. One commenter suggested that points be awarded to proposals with employer and union partnerships. One commenter suggested that, in the absence of a union, workers should be involved in planning the project. Another commenter suggested that points be awarded to applications_(1) with effective plans to involve workers in the educational provider's decision-making process; and (2) that emphasize participatory teaching methods. Several commenters thought that union and worker involvement would improve the recruitment, interest, and commitment of the workforce, and help to allay fears that a project would result in the loss of jobs for employees failing to demonstrate learning gains. Discussion: Section 371(a)(1) of the Act permits, but does not require, a labor organization to be a partner in an application under this program. This provision is reflected in §472.2(a) and (b). As indicated in §472.2(c), a labor organization, like any partner, must participate in a joint application for funding and sign a partnership agreement. However, the Secretary does not believe that a written statement regarding union consultation should be required of partnerships that do not include a labor organization. Nevertheless, the Secretary encourages all partnerships to involve workers and, as appropriate, labor organizations in matters related to the project. This arrangement should provide a number of benefits, including allaying any concerns that workers may have about participating in a project. Changes: None. Intergovernmental Review These programs are subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. The objective of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance. In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program. Assessment of Educational Impact In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.
