Title: ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS
Author: STEVE HARVEY
Abstract: null
Text: Sure, the traffic -- and the pace of life in general -- is becoming more hectic here. Luckily, there's an antidote. This appears to be the massage capital of the world, judging from a survey of LA Weekly. The newspaper carries classified ads for Russian massage, holistic massage, hypnotic massage (no nude or topless), French massage, student massage, Asian massage, German massage, Swedish massage, and a home-grown version, "California Swedish massage" (no doubt featuring an avocado spread on the customer's body). There's even Australian massage. G'day! A ski resort's sign on U.S. 395 near Lone Pine contends: "We have more flakes than Venice Beach." Even in the summer? The Medflies keep coming back -- their return is less romantic than the swallows' -- but Chris Norby has no plans to update his 8-year-old Monopoly-like Medfly Game. "It's a little outdated now," acknowledged Norby, a Fullerton city councilman. "It's got people like (former Gov.) Jerry Brown, Orson Welles and (former Lt. Gov.) Mike Curb." Norby says he sold "a couple thousand" copies of the board game, which was "more political satire than a kids' game." Some of its "Crop Cards," similar to Monopoly's "Chance" and "Community Chest" cards, still seem current though. For instance: * "Medfly attacks Telly Savalas after mistaking him for a Honeydew melon." * "Malibu health food store begins selling carob-coated Medflies as gourmet delicacies." Dan Dektar reports that the slowing drivers who jammed up the Valley's freeways the other day to watch the last flight of Lockheed's SR-71 Blackbird spy plane weren't alone. Dektar spotted a Southern Pacific freight train that had stopped, with the engineer leaning his head out the window to take a gander. About 3,147 former pieces of evidence arrived at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank on Thursday, which was good news for the needy. The frozen delicacies were confiscated California spiny lobsters donated by the state Department of Fish and Game to the bank, which accepts private and public food donations and distributes them to 475 agencies in the county. Seized in August, 1988, because they were smaller than the legal limit, the costly crustaceans remained in cold storage as evidence against the fish companies that bought them. No jurors or lawyers handled the goods during the judicial proceedings, by the way. They were viewed from a distance. Speaking of good news, Ethel Bruce of North Hollywood has a message for an old friend, Alyse McLaughlin. Bruce was saddened to read that McLaughlin was one of the people whose residence was damaged in the Westwood fire. Bruce phoned The Times to say: "If she lost her personal things, I want her to know that I have 17 years of Christmas cards that contain photos of her family from the 1940s through the 1960s. I'd be only too happy to give them to her." Employees at Cal State Northridge are officially celebrating Abraham Lincoln's birthday today. No, it's not a reflection on the school's history department. This bit of revisionism stems from the fact that there are no classes this week and that many employees take those days off anyhow. So the state universities rescheduled several holidays, including the 16th President's birth, for the last week. Honest Abe. Meanwhile, a group of local history buffs excitedly report that they've formed the Millard Fillmore Bicentennial Commission. They're planning what surely will be a giant nationwide celebration of the 200th anniversary of the 13th President's birth. As every Fillmore fan knows, the big day will be Jan. 7, 2000. Theme of the celebration, according to Panorama City pediatrician Hal Bass, will be: "A New Millennium and Millard, Too." Let's hope Cal State Northridge doesn't gum up the works by celebrating it in December of 1999.

Title: 'PEACE: CHALLENGE AND OPPORTUNITY'
Author: null
Abstract: null
Text: Your editorial of Dec. 14 remarked upon the results of a study indicating that the Los Angeles area can survive economically even if military spending is cut back significantly. That Los Angeles could prosper as something other than a center of military production is no surprise to the members of Jobs With Peace who, in 1984, won the ballot initiative that forced Los Angeles to authorize the study. Long-term prosperity not only can be based on non-military commerce, it must be. Now that military spending and tax cuts for the wealthy have exhausted the nation's financial resources, Los Angeles will be forced to build a peacetime economic base. Perhaps the Proposition X study, opposed by The Times and many others in the city's leadership, will provide guidance as to how this can be done. RICHARD DAWSON Member, Jobs With Peace Los Angeles

Title: MAN OF THE DECADE'S CHALLENGE
Author: null
Abstract: null
Text: Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is a few days away from the most severe test of his six incredible years in office. Ironically, passing the test would probably mean pushing aside the Communist Party in the Soviet Union farther and faster than seemed possible just months ago. The test involves a decision by the Lithuanian Communist Party, made just before Christmas, to break away from the Soviet Communist Party. The vote in Vilnius left the first visible crack in the national party since Lenin's revolution. The defection by one of the Soviet Union's tinier republics seems to have rocked the Kremlin more than the collapse of communism in all six Warsaw Pact nations since August. Moscow is taking the defection hard because now, more than at any time since the Soviet government abandoned the brute force it inherited from Stalin, the Communist Party is what holds the Soviet empire together. Gorbachev himself subscribed to that during this week's emergency meeting of the party's Central Committee, drawing no line between the party and the state. Calling the Lithuanian vote to break away "illegitimate," he said that "the current party and state leadership will not permit the breakup of the state." The committee could not decide exactly how to react, choosing instead to send Gorbachev to Lithuania to see whether the considerable powers of leadership and persuasion that make him Time Magazine's Man of the Decade can coax a reversal from the Lithuanians. The numbers are against him. Fewer than 20% of Lithuania's party members voted against the break, mostly Russian or Polish nationals or military officers. Three things make Lithuania such a severe test for Gorbachev. One is that his reform policies encouraged the break. Lithuanians live better than most Soviets, partly because they work harder. Some months ago, Gorbachev persuaded the new Soviet Parliament to give Lithuania economic autonomy, partly so its people could show Soviets how market socialism can work. Another is a fear among leaders in Moscow that if the Soviet empire is allowed to chip itself apart one republic at a time, the common Russian house will turn into a common vacant lot. Lithuania's neighbors along the Baltic coast, Latvia and Estonia, are prepared to follow suit. The third factor, the nationalities problem, intensifies the others. The Republic of Georgia, in the far south of the Soviet Union, has served notice that it wants out. If Lithuania's Communists can peel away, Armenia's will certainly try. Gorbachev is Time's Man of the Decade largely because he has made a case with actions and not just words that he is serious about ending the Cold War. That the United States misjudged its own surrogate forces in Afghanistan does not cancel the fact that he did pull his troops out of that country. He didn't lift a finger to save communism in the Warsaw Pact nations. Taking the first of what he says will be many troops and tanks from Europe is another example. But Lithuania may be intractable, and one bad move could weaken much of the goodwill he has built up in the West. If Lithuania's Communist leaders refuse to back down, he could fire them. But there is no sign that new leaders would be more effective in stifling the republic's yearning for independence. He could declare martial law, but that would bring out centuries of bad blood going back to the days of Peter the Great and would surely lead to violence. It may be too much to expect an answer for every problem from this remarkable man whose energy and gift for surprise have dominated global politics for the latter half of the 1980s. But we would not be surprised to see him pull this one out. He might, for example, tell Lithuania's leaders that if they want to set a pattern for breaking away, they owe him a pattern for staying in. If they want to pull out of the Soviet Communist Party -- a step that others republics are certain to follow -- they must draft a framework that the others could also use to remain part of a Soviet federation. Nothing in real life is ever quite that tidy. But Gorbachev must find a better option than martial law if he is to keep skeptics in the West persuaded that his goal remains ending the Cold War.

Title: LOS ANGELES' 3RD AREA CODE
Author: null
Abstract: null
Text: The plan by the telephone companies to add a third area code to the Los Angeles area sparked controversy even before the ink was dry on the newspapers carrying the story (Part A, Dec. 13). Demographic problems by businesses, the needs to change stationery and other issues, many unknown at this time could give rise to actions including lawsuits by irate customers. Both telephone companies cite an expansion in services arising from high-technology advances as the cause. Consumer use of cellular telephones, fax machines, beepers and modems is involved, not to mention an increase in the population. While Pacific Bell and GTE may be correct in their assessment, there is an alternative to allay the fears of those affected and at the same time ameliorate the utilities' problems. Why not apply the 310 area code to the new high-tech users; cellular phones, beepers, faxes, etc. The logistics should be no worse than those of the 800, 900 and 976 area codes. BEN URMAN Van Nuys

Title: A FAMILY FELINE TAKES THE MEASURE OF A MAN; CATS: ANYONE WHO WOULD CALL THESE ANIMALS DOMESTICATED HAS NOT PONDERED THEIR BEWITCHERY AT 4 A.M.
Author: GEORGE F. WILL, George F. Will writes a syndicated column in Washington.
Abstract: null
Text: I announced it and meant it: No cats. I am an austere father, deaf to the entreaties of children chafing beneath parental sovereignty. Well, deaf to the entreaties of male children. But then, there is Victoria, who is 9 and perfect and has eyes that express entreaties in the most melting manner. She wanted a cat for Christmas. Let me tell you about our cat. Winston is white and, like Victoria, is alternately sweet and volatile, playful and somber -- and lovely to look at. A cat does furnish a room. Like a graceful vase, a cat, even when motionless, seems to flow. But a cat also is a flawlessly designed killer. It is lost in the mists of history, the moment when cats condescended to adopt people. From this transaction, cats got room and board. People got civilization. Cats are carnivores that prey on vegetarians. When humans advanced from hunter-gatherers to tillers of soil, they needed cats. Agriculture, and hence everything else, depends upon storage of surpluses, and hence depends on control of mice and rats. Small wonder Egyptians worshiped cats. Later, when Europe was swept by plagues, cats helped control rodents that were disease carriers. Cats sleep more than other mammals -- 16 hours a day, a few minutes ("cat naps") at a time -- but even in deepest sleep their brains are as active as when they are awake, processing information. The stories of cats bolting from buildings just before earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are true. The myth of a feline "sixth sense" reflects the refinement of the five senses, including the ability to sense minute tremors and changes in air pressure. Although there are about 500 million domestic cats in the world (and more strays than that), in a sense the phrase "domestic cat" is an oxymoron. The cat-and-mouse "game" of trap-and-release that a cat plays with a prey before killing it is rare in the wild. It is the behavior of cats with too few opportunities to express their instinct to kill. However, cats kill for natural, ecologically rational reasons. That is more than can be said for mankind, which has made cats the focus of virulent superstitions. For centuries the Christian church encouraged the belief that cats were associated with -- even were -- witches. Some persons convicted of witchcraft were drowned in sacks full of cats. Among the festivities at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth in 1558 was the burning of an effigy of the Pope -- stuffed with live cats. Even in 19th-Century France, some Christian festivals included roasting baskets full of live cats, whose ashes were considered sources of good luck. J. C. Suares, who has written much about cats and recounts these and other atrocities, wonders what in the nature of cats (dogs have no similar history) taunts humans to fury. The answer may be in the fact that Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon and Mussolini hated cats, surely because cats are embodiments of independence. (It is said that cats even purr to please themselves.) But if solitariness and inscrutability arouse against cats the brute that sleeps lightly in mankind, those qualities make cats especially suitable companions for creative people, because creativity requires solitude. Isaac Newton took time off from finding laws of physics to invent the "cat flap" that enables cats to avoid the ultimate cat horror, the closed door. Samuel Johnson took time off from dictionary-writing to shop for oysters for his cat Hodge. One of Charles Dickens' cats used his paw to snuff out Dickens' candle when the cat thought it was time to play. Henry James, he of the feline subtlety of syntax, would sometimes write with a cat on his shoulder. Mark Twain, who, like Hemingway, kept cats (Hemingway as many as 30 at a time), believed that, "If man could be crossed with the cat, it would improve man but deteriorate the cat." As a cat fancier has written, your cat is undoubtedly the cleanest member of your household and the only one who eats no more than necessary. And Winston is a user-friendly cat. In fact, too much so. He and I need to come to an understanding about this practice of putting his nose on the nose of Victoria's father at 4 a.m., an act which, the day after Christmas, caused the iron to enter my soul: I now have three children, two dogs and a cat. That's it. No more. I am an immovable object: No more pets. Unless Victoria, wants a horse, in which case. . . . It is said that as long as little girls are interested in quadrupeds (horses are another of Victoria's passions), they are not apt to develop strong interests in bipeds of the boy variety. I plan to have cats and other pets for a while.DR, Punch

Title: THE 'HOME PLANET' IS PRECIOUS; SPACE FLIGHT: WHEN ASTRONAUTS AND COSMONAUTS GATHER, THERE IS NO RIVALRY, ONLY AGREEMENT THAT WE MUST SAVE THE FRAGILE EARTH.
Author: PAT MURPHY, Pat Murphy retired in August as publisher of the Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette.
Abstract: null
Text: In the dunes of the Al-Thuamalah desert, 50 kilometers from this capital of Saudi Arabia, a bus made in Japan, bearing American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts, got hopelessly stuck in axle-deep sand while trying to reach a Bedouin encampment for dinner under a full moon. The space fliers, in the Saudi kingdom last month for their annual meeting of the Assn. of Space Explorers, proceeded in good humor to try pushing the trapped vehicle free with their combined muscle power. Alas, failure. Aleksei Leonov, the bald, jovial Soviet cosmonaut who was the first to walk in space at the end of a tether, shrugged in mock exasperation and said in rough-edged but passable English: "Gentlemen, we have spent the afternoon in meetings discussing how to rescue each other in space in the event of an emergency. How do we expect to rescue each other in space if we cannot rescue each other from the sand?" Roars of laughter, as the stranded veterans of space flight surrendered to the sand and walked the remaining distance to the camp. There were other episodes such as that, when mirth and backslapping collegiality characterized the bond shared by the 19 American and 20 Soviet space fliers (as well as 11 mission specialists and a number of spouses) who came together here. But there was more to this meeting of superpower space heroes that was uniquely illustrative of the changes now sweeping this world. This was the first time that the rigorously anti-communist Saudi kingdom had allowed any such visits by Soviets since diplomatic relations were severed in 1930. The spectacle of Soviet and American space fliers dressed in long traditional Saudi thobes, sitting cross-legged on carpets in a Saudi Bedouin tent far into the desert and plunging both hands into an abundant Arab repast with their Saudi hosts, was the ultimate tribute to change. And these men whose political leaders have for nearly four decades sought ways to create yet more nuclear destructive power unanimously adopted an appeal to the world imploring mankind to find ways of ending abuse to the fragile environment of what cosmonauts and astronauts lovingly call "The Home Planet." There was no East-West name-calling or finger-pointing, no talk of military arms or nuclear weapons. But anyone who mingled with these men during this historic and remarkable meeting could read into their private words and their public statements an unmistakable message: Those who've seen Mother Earth from space -- the 220 men and women in this elite group -- are horrified by abuses that have spread air and water pollution. They are disbelieving that man would fire nuclear missiles on this fragile planet. Two of the participants had seen Earth at its smallest from the farthest distance -- Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon in 1969 and Apollo 11 shipmate Mike Collins piloted the lunar-orbiting command module. The statement noted that space pilots who have left the planet more than once have seen the gradual erosion of air and water quality -- the appearance of ominous oil slicks and drifting air pollution that respect no national borders. "Opportunities of space," the communique read, "are meaningless if mankind ignores the opportunities for enriching life on Earth. (We have) seen from afar the dangers that can imperil our planet, and thus poison the quality of life that will be inherited by generations yet unborn." All of those who've seen Earth from afar return with an identical shared emotion -- that mankind lives on a small, delicate planet whose livability is in peril. Each of them has contributed some memorable quote to the history of manned flight into space. One that seems to capture the flavor of most came from Saudi Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, 33, who flew in 1985 on the U.S. shuttle Discovery, and was the conference host. "The first day or so (in space), we all pointed to our countries," Salman said. "The third or fourth day we were pointing to our continents. By the fifth day, we were aware of only one Earth." Were it possible, all future East-West summits or future negotiations between warring nations should be held in space, aboard a shuttle, where men who would threaten Earth's survival with unthinkable acts of war and despoliation could see the precious planet that space fliers have seen.

Title: BYU FACES FIGHT OVER AIR TIME; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: EXPECT PENN STATE TO TRY A HARD-HITTING APPROACH TO BRIGHAM YOUNG'S PASSING ATTACK TONIGHT.
Author: CURT HOLBREICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: Those looking for insight into how tonight's Holiday Bowl game between Brigham Young and Penn State could unfold might want to turn to the film from the 1987 Fiesta Bowl. That was the last time Penn State, known for conservative offenses and rugged defenses, played a team that boasted proudly of a potent passing game and talented quarterback. The opponent was Miami, the quarterback Vinny Testaverde. And the result was a 14-10 victory in which Penn State secured its second national title in five seasons. With that kind of history as a guide, it is little wonder that as soon as the Cougars clinched the Western Athletic Conference title and Holiday Bowl berth five weeks ago, they went about obtaining a copy of that three-year-old Fiesta Bowl film. They will attempt to put what they saw and what they might have learned to use tonight when No. 19 BYU (10-2) and No. 18 Penn State (7-3-1) meet for the first time at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium at 5 p.m. "We figured it would be worth a look," said BYU quarterback Ty Detmer, whose 4,560 passing yards this season were the most by a sophomore in NCAA history. "They must have done something right that game, because they sure made it rough on Miami." The Lions intercepted five Testaverde passes, including one at the goal line in the final seconds to end Miami's last-minute attempt at a rally. "What we saw (on film) is that they just play hard," Detmer said. "They didn't do anything special; they just played a great game." Detmer can only wonder if he is in for more of the same when his turn comes. "They are a lot more physical than most of the teams we play," Detmer said. "You can see they really hit hard." Penn State's hardest hitter might be the senior Andre Collins, one of five finalist for the Butkus Award as the best linebacker in college football. Collins has issued a quiet but sobering warning to the Cougars. "With any good passing team, you want to hit hard," Collins said. "You want the receivers to think before they catch the ball. You want the quarterback to worry about being hit." Strength against finesse. The differences between the two teams could hardly be clearer. "It's going to be the classic running team against the classic passing team," said BYU tight end Chris Smith, the team's leading receiver with 60 catches for 1,090 yards. "They also have a real strong defense, but our defense can be extremely strong against the run." Statistically, Smith is correct. The Cougars are 36th in the country in rushing defense, allowing 137.7 yards allowed per game. But this selfishness might have something to do with their vulnerability against the pass and the fact they play in the pass-oriented WAC. BYU ranked 104 out of 106 National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I-A teams in passing defense, surrendering 266.9 yards per game. That could be a concern for BYU, but it might be somewhat lessened by the fact that the Lions have had trouble moving the ball through the air. They are averaging only 118.6 passing yards, not the kind of low-output passing attack the Cougars have become accustomed to in the WAC. Part of Penn State's problem has been at quarterback, where Coach Joe Paterno has had trouble choosing between junior Tom Bill and sophomore Tony Sacca. Bill started the first two games, and Sacca took over as starter for the next nine. In naming Sacca the starter against BYU, Paterno said both should play. "My quarterbacks know we're going to have to pass the ball if we want to win," Paterno said. "They have accepted that challenge, and they have worked hard at practice." But if they can't, Penn State can always turn to senior Blair Thomas, its All-American running back. Thomas, who sat out last season following reconstructive knee surgery, rushed for 1,341 yards, the fourth-best season total in school history. And his career total of 3,301 yards is second on the school's all-time list to Curt Warner's 3,398. The Cougars do not have such a publicized alternative to their passing game -- senior fullback Fred Whittingham has gained 617 yards, scored eight touchdowns and averaged 5.3 yards per carry. Their offense clearly is designed around the pass. BYU ranked second to Houston in passing offense, averaging 394.3 yards per game, and second in total offense, averaging 540.4. Their 40.3 points per game provide an interesting contrast to the Lions, who are averaging just 19.0. That would not be enough to win most games if not for a defense that is allowing just 11.8. The Lions' three losses came in the only games in which they allowed more than 13 points: Virginia (14-6), Alabama (17-16) and Notre Dame (34-23). "This is a big test for us nationally," Detmer said. "We know we have to score a lot of points on them if we want to win, and they don't give up that many." Detmer said he figures something has to give against the Penn State defense. His greatest hope might be that, unlike Testaverde, it's not him.

Title: AZTECS CAN'T SUSTAIN EARLY SUCCESS, LOSE FINAL
Author: SCOTT MILLER
Abstract: null
Text: Fourteen minutes into Thursday night's Texaco Star tournament championship game against Villanova, San Diego State guard Michael Best trotted over to Coach Jim Brandenburg during a break. The juices were flowing, the ESPN television cameras were rolling, and Best had a request. "I need the ball," he pleaded. It was that kind of half. Best had just converted a three-point play, but he wasn't particularly hot. It was just that, if you were wearing a white Aztec uniform, you wanted the ball. They had the lead, they had momentum, and most of all, they were having fun. But in the end, the Aztecs couldn't quite pull the upset off. Final score: Villanova 57, SDSU 52 in front of 4,940 at the San Diego Sports Arena. Revenge? Not tonight. Villanova had already defeated SDSU this season, 66-58, in the Maui Classic on Thanksgiving weekend. Before that, Villanova defeated the Aztecs in the 1982 Cabrillo tournament championship (before it became the Texaco Star), 63-57. With this in mind, the Aztecs battled all of the man-to-mans and zone traps and presses Villanova threw at them Thursday. They scored the game's first 12 points and never trailed in the first half. They played through the foul trouble of center Marty Dow (fourth foul with 14:39 left in the game) and Best (fourth with 12:59 left), and they watched 7-feet-3 Villanova center Tom Greis foul out with 4:37 to play in the game. But Villanova guard Chris Walker hit three three-point shots in the second half, the first two keeping Villanova close and the third giving the Wildcats a 49-47 lead with 4:18 left, a lead they would not relinquish. The Aztecs had the ball and trailed by three, 55-52, but Arthur Massey missed a shot with 13 seconds left, and Villanova's Calvin Byrd blocked Dow's follow with 10 seconds left to force a jump ball. Byrd made two free throws with eight seconds left to finish off the Aztecs. For the game, Walker made five of seven three-pointers and finished with 17 points. Best had 16 to lead SDSU, Jamison added 12 and Dow 11. It was SDSU's fourth Texaco Star tournament championship appearance in four years. Last year, SDSU lost to Tennessee, 77-75; two years ago, the Aztecs won the title over Texas Tech, 72-63, and three years ago SDSU lost to Mississippi, 88-77. Overall, it was SDSU's ninth championship game appearance. The Aztecs have won three. SDSU never trailed in the first half. Villanova managed one tie, 26-26, when Walker made a three-point shot with 4:34 left before halftime. Other than that, the first half fluctuated between SDSU dominating and hanging on. It started with the Aztecs dominating. Maybe Villanova was flat after defeating Clemson in the tournament's opening round Wednesday. Maybe the Wildcats were in a funk because a rare San Diego rainstorm Thursday dampened their holiday excursion. Whatever, SDSU stormed to a 12-0 lead with 15:59 left in the half. During that span, the Aztecs made five of seven field goal attempts and turned three Villanova turnovers into seven points. Villanova made just two field goals in the first 8 1/2 minutes. But SDSU then turned cold and let Villanova back into the game. The Aztecs went through a spell in which they missed just one shot in 13 possessions -- they made seven -- but turned the ball over five times. Pretty soon, the score was tied. Dow made two free throws, and forward Vern Thompson swished a 15-footer to give the Aztecs a 30-27 halftime lead. Combined, SDSU and Villanova made just two of their final 12 shots in the half. The Aztecs made 11 of 26 field goals (42%) in the first half. Villanova made just eight of 20 (40%). Clemson easily won the third-place game, defeating Niagara, 85-65. The biggest surprise came at the opening tip, when Clemson's 6-foot-11 center, Elden Campbell, was sitting on the bench. "Three words -- concentration, aggressiveness and production," Tiger Coach Cliff Ellis said. Campbell eventually got a grip on those three things, scoring 21 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. But it was guard Derrick Forrest's night. Forrest tied a career high with 23 points. "It was just one of those special nights," he said. "I just said I was going to go out and get ready for the conference season." Clemson opens Atlantic Coast Conference play Wednesday at North Carolina State. Clemson took a 6-0 lead before Niagara scored 13 of the next 15 points to go ahead, 13-8. It stayed even for most of the first half, and Clemson led at the intermission, 39-33. This was despite the urging of Niagara's 26-year-old Jack Armstrong, the youngest Division I basketball coach in the country. With his constant screaming, waving and stamping, he was easily the most demonstrative coach of the tournament. And when Rollie Massimino is here, that's quite an accomplishment. Midway through the second half, Armstrong had coaxed all he could out of Niagara, and Clemson's superior athletic ability surfaced. Clemson opened a 58-45 lead and was never again in danger. Aztec Notes SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said the Aztecs will likely red-shirt freshman forward Courtie Miller, a former standout at Torrey Pines High School. "I'd say that's where we're headed," Brandenburg said. "We'd like not to use up a year of his eligibility, because we value his talent and his potential so much." Miller has played a total of just eight minutes in four games this season and he hasn't played since Dec. 6 against the University of San Diego. He is limping on a sprained ankle now and is recovering from a hamstring pull. Since he has played in four games, NCAA rules stipulate that he can only be red-shirted for medical reasons. SDSU is red-shirting two other players this season -- Nelson Stewart, who played in three games but has a bad knee, and Terrence Hamilton (Patrick Henry). . . . Entering Thursday's game, SDSU had won seven games in a row in the San Diego Sports Arena -- five this season and their final two last season. . . . Shawn Jamison's 91% shooting from the floor in Wednesday night's SDSU victory over Niagara was a tournament record.

Title: SOCKERS SCORE LAST 6 GOALS, ROUT CRUNCH
Author: Staff and Wire Reports
Abstract: null
Text: When the Sockers' goal-scorers begin playing defense, the team usually begins a string of victories. "And that usually doesn't start until the playoff," says Ron Newman, the Sockers' coach. It started early this year. In fact, it started midway through the second period of Thursday night's game against the Cleveland Crunch and led to a 9-4 Major Indoor Soccer League victory. The Sockers evened their record at 8-8 and moved to within 1 1/2 games of MISL West leader Dallas, which suffered a 5-1 loss at home to Baltimore Thursday night. "It was a very strange game," Newman said. "I put a very offensive team out there, and talking to the players before the game, we knew we could put the ball in the back of the net. We just didn't know if we could defend enough." After the first quarter, it didn't look as though the Sockers could defend at all. Cleveland led, 4-3. But they regrouped and scored the game's final six goals. Zoran Karic and Cacho each scored two. Cacho started the string 2:31 into the second quarter, and 10 minutes later, Waad Hirmez scored to put the Sockers ahead for good, 5-4. It was Hirmez's eighth goal of the year and fourth game-winner, tying him for the league lead with Chico Borja of Wichita and Billy Ronson of Baltimore. There were no big heroes on defense, Newman said. "We just worked a lot harder from top to bottom (of our roster) to keep their players from getting the ball," he said. "When we do that, that's when we look good." In fact, Kevin Crow, last year's MISL defender of the year, did not get a block for his second consecutive game and is still four short of becoming only the third player in league history to reach the 600 level. But Brian Quinn, a midfielder, had three. Branko Segota had three assists to tie Juli Veee as the Sockers' all-time points leader with 467. Goalie Victor Nogueira improved to 4-4, though he had a season-low seven saves. The Sockers continue their trip Saturday night at Eastern Division leader Baltimore.

Title: SAN DIEGO DANCE IN THE EIGHTIES; DURING DECADE, SAN DIEGO DANCE TOOK BIG STEP FORWARD
Author: EILEEN SONDAK
Abstract: null
Text: The 1980s will be remembered as a major turning point for dance in San Diego. Although Terpsichore has yet to attain the status enjoyed by her sister arts, the passing decade was marked by progress throughout the dance community. San Diego State University dance professor Patricia Sandback has been observing the dance scene from both sides of the footlights since the 1960s. Totally bullish on the changing scene, she said the '80s were marked by growth. "It was a time of growth in dancers' technique, in the ability to make choreography and in the number of dance companies," Sandback said. Victoria Hamilton, executive director of the San Diego Commission for Arts and Culture, said: "We have a lot of companies and an international presence. We've more than tripled dance support, and the new degree program in dance at San Diego State University will prove very important to this growth." Dance in the '80s has been a rich melting pot of local and imported products. Home-grown efforts from both organized troupes and independent artists mushroomed. Educational opportunities at every level increased by leaps and bounds. More organizations got into the act of importing dance events during this dynamic decade than ever before in the annals of San Diego dance. The city's dance card began to overflow in 1987 with two major presenters (San Diego Foundation for the Performing Arts and San Diego Performances) booking a bumper crop of big-league dance attractions, and a profusion of other purveyors -- Sushi and UC San Diego's University Events program among them -- offering a variety of smaller-scale imports and locally produced concerts. The explosion of dance on home turf ran the gamut from name-brand ballet companies to cutting-edge avant-gardists. The San Diego Area Dance Alliance, a collective representing dance troupes and independent dance makers, brought the splintered sectors of local dance together for the first time in 1981, and began its concerted effort to encourage excellence and improve the image of San Diego dance. Since then, the alliance has been an active catalyst for growth by providing services and a communications network never before available here. The organization even took on a new role as sponsor of the Georgian State National Singing and Dancing Ensemble during the Soviet arts festival this year. Tom Corcoran, executive director of the alliance, is convinced that dance is moving on a steady upward course, despite what he considers its second-fiddle status in the arts community. "The city is now making more funding available than ever before," he said. "But remember, the city provided facilities for the symphony, the opera and other art forms. What really kept dance from developing even more during the '80s was the lack of facilities. "There's a real need for (dance) theaters," he said. "Music and the institutions in Balboa Park have benefited directly or indirectly from public support. They're further along because they've had the facilities." Maxine Mahon, who founded California Ballet 22 years ago, watched the amount of dance increase tremendously during the '80s, but she shares Corcoran's frustration. "We haven't grown enough to keep pace with the size of the city. The three major dance groups should have full-salaried dancers by now, and we don't," she said. "Sacramento and Louisville can pay for a small company, but we can't. People say if you're good you'll get support, but that's not true." None of the local bellwethers has any serious doubts about past gains in the dance community. However, as choreographer James Kelly (who left town for greener pastures in the early 1980s) observed: "Yes, there's been a lot of growth, but when I came back, I was surprised how much the theater had grown in that same time. Dance had only made an inch of progress compared to theater." "Dance never keeps pace with the other arts anywhere," said former Twyla Tharp dancer John Malashock, a native San Diegan. "But we're doing in dance now what (other art forms) were doing 20 years ago -- we're starting the exodus from New York. "New York has become an oppressive atmosphere to work," Malashock said. "They put you on a pedestal one day and then you're out. (Artists) want to come to places like this now." Some of the best programs of the decade were presented by organizations dedicated only to sponsoring -- not producing -- major dance events. But the successes were tempered by some disappointments as well. The era critics hailed as a renaissance for dance took a few steps backward -- right on the heels of its most ambitious forward leap. Two movers and shakers played prominent roles in the imported dance revolution -- Danah Fayman and Suzanne Townsend. The duo began working as a team (under the name San Diego Arts Foundation) in 1982-83, with a four-attraction season of name brands, such as the Joffrey Ballet. By 1986, the foundation's budget was more than $1 million, but the two founders parted company. Fayman changed her organization's name to the San Diego Foundation for the Performing Arts, and Townsend went on to create San Diego Performances -- a rival presenting organization that whisked away some of the biggest draws on the foundation's ticket. However, San Diego Performances began to feel the pinch of megabuck budgets and sluggish funding. Last October, the San Francisco Ballet canceled its "Nutcracker" performances, calling attention to serious fiscal problems that plague the organization. Reports that some of the troupes on last year's roster, and the musicians who played for them, have not been paid have tarnished the organization's image, and the organization has yet to announce any major funding sources to wipe out its debts or ensure its continued existence. With the newly formed San Diego Performances sponsoring the name brands, the Foundation for the Performing Arts moved into riskier attractions, such as Laura Dean and Dancers. But the lesser-known bookings, along with the competition from the rival presenting group, took a toll on the foundation's box office, so two of the more avant-garde events on the 1988-89 schedule -- the Jose Limon and Trisha Brown companies -- were canceled in a drastic attempt to balance the budget. Although the foundation came back with a balanced budget this season, present uncertainties and recent fiscal woes might signal a bumpy road ahead for dance in San Diego. "The setback is more embarrassing than damaging," said William Fark of Dance magazine. It's not a disgrace. It's been a good decade for dance. It's been the most promising decade San Diego ever had. "We have national and international exposure now for local companies. And just the fact that we have so many more dance schools tells us something. They wouldn't be here if there weren't plenty of potential customers." In sheer numbers, there were more gains than losses to record among dance companies during the '80s. But numbers alone can be deceiving. San Diego Ballet -- the city's only professional ballet company -- went belly up right at the start of the decade. And that was a tremendous blow to San Diego dance, because no other ballet troupe ever came along to fill its shoes. As former company dancer Susan Wingfield pointed out, "It didn't just mean the end of a professional ballet company, it meant we lost most of those trained dancers to other parts of the country." San Diego Ballet had been on shaky financial ground even before its director John Hart, formerly of the Royal Ballet and current director of Salt Lake City's Ballet West, decided to put a full roster of dancers on salary in the fall of 1979. Early in 1980 -- with no money to pay the contracted dancers -- the company was forced to close its doors. Thereafter, attempts were made to merge San Diego Ballet with California Ballet. And in 1984, a proposal to form a bi-coastal arrangement with the Hartford Ballet received serious attention. Neither bore fruit, however, and the company's charter was given over to David Shields, a dance instructor who tried vainly to muster support for a born-again company from San Diego Ballet's downtown studio. But Shields cashed in his chips and returned to London. It appears the dream of resuscitating the professional ballet troupe has been put to rest. Fortunately, many promising dance groups have evolved in this fertile 10-year period. And all the other established companies that were prominent at the beginning of the '80s continue to progress. Leading the pack is California Ballet, founded by Maxine Mahon (an ex-San Diego Ballet dancer). The troupe's 22-year survival is the school-based company's greatest claim to fame. Only a small handful of others around the country have achieved such a milestone. And, despite the troupe's failure to garner strong financial support or a reputation for artistic excellence, Cal Ballet has reached some impressive high-water marks. In the mid-'80s, the company began beefing up its repertory with works by leading choreographers, including George Balanchine and Jose Limon. It broke new ground by importing a Soviet danseur, Stanislav Issaev, to star in its 1986 "Nutcracker" -- well before glasnost. In 1988, the troupe boasted another first in East-West relations when Soviet choreographer Mikhail Lavrovsky mounted a world premiere for the company. And earlier this year, a California Ballet student, Calvin Kitten, began a year of study in the Soviet Union as part of a cultural exchange program. California Ballet will start the decade with another major coup: the first U.S. appearance by members of the Leningrad State Ballet for a six-week residency to teach the troupe dances never seen in this country. The decade's biggest success story in local dance is Three's Company, which grew from a trio that added pickup dancers for every concert to a relatively stable chamber-size company with a national profile, including critical acclaim in New York in addition to its several performances in Western cities. In 1987, Three's Company was selected for the California Arts Council's touring roster, and it focused on the works of its two resident choreographers, Jean Isaacs and Nancy McCaleb. The 16-year-old modern-dance company has been active in presenting as well as performing from its earliest days. In 1981 the company included the likes of Martha Graham and Bella Lewitzky on its subscription series. Summer concerts at the troupe's studio have played host to hundreds of artists -- local, national and even international -- throughout the decade. Betzi Roe, co-founder of Three's Company, emerged as a major figure in her own right during the '80s. Along with her dancing and occasional choreography for the company, Roe created a showcase for the work of female California dance makers, and performs solo around the country. Jazz Unlimited bowed in at the end of 1977 as Strictly Jazz. By 1982, under its present name, it had gained wide popularity -- but not respect for its artistry or much financial support. However, from its earliest days, the company served as a launching pad for some of the city's finest jazz-based dancers -- including Barry Bernal of Broadway fame. The troupe has changed artistic directions somewhat over the years, importing choreographers, collaborating with other artists and, most recently, experimenting with mainstream modern styles. In 1980 -- the same year San Diego Ballet expired -- the American Ballet School opened its doors under the direction of former Balanchine ballerina Lynda Yourth. Within three years, the school created a performing ensemble (American Ballet Ensemble) and a children's group to showcase the emerging dancers. By 1985, ABE was attracting attention as "the other" ballet company, and performing its own full-length "Nutcracker." The ensemble formed ties to Mexico and became the first American ballet company to perform at the Centro Cultural in Tijuana, where the group still dances on a regular basis. San Diego Dance Theatre, a modern-dance group that debuted in 1967, had a seesaw existence until the latter part of the 1980s, when it performed on home turf and in several Mexican venues. An ambitious attempt to concertize at the Lyceum Theatre in 1988, however, spelled fiscal disaster, and the organization has been in limbo ever since. Stage Seven Dance Theater, the brainchild of European-trained ballet teacher Marius Zirra, made a promising debut in 1981, but has undergone two major administrative changes and some rough times financially since. Now, under Kathryn Irey's direction, Stage Seven has begun to carve its own modest niche as a group devoted to diversity and to commissioning new works. Two major additions to the local dance scene have emerged in the latter portion of the decade, along with several collaborative efforts by independent artists. Malashock Dance and Company made its official debut in 1988, and proved that John Malashock was more than just a dynamic dancer. His dark choreography and hand-picked dancers earned immediate critical acclaim, and the Twyla Tharp alumnus was welcomed as the brightest new star on the local horizon. Al Germani is another choreographer who created a company in his own image recently. The Al Germani Dance Company gave its premiere performance in April, and has already announced three dates for 1990. Independents often team up in San Diego to showcase their work, but these mini-alliances seldom last beyond a single concert. Not so with Big Ladies, a threesome formed by Ellen Segal, Patricia Sandback and Marta Jiacoletti in 1986. The trio gave three performances, but an injury to Jiacoletti sidelined the group indefinitely. Sandback formalized her own company (Patricia Sandback and Dancers) in '89, and Segal continues to pop up in concert settings around town. Ethnic dance has been alive and well throughout the '80s, but much of it exists outside the mainstream. Two Philippine troupes -- the Samahan and the Pasacat Dance Company -- make regular appearances on local stages. However, Mexican folklorico and flamenco groups rarely make it to the concert stage. Aside from the major presenters, other organizations have also been involved in importing dance to San Diego. UCSD's University Events Series has been presenting imported dance on the home front for years. In fact, it was the first to feature Twyla Tharp (1980), Lar Lubovitch and Paul Taylor (1981) and other important artists. SDSU had no formal program for presenting dance, but it managed to host many important dance events during the period, although it has lagged behind in the past couple of years. Sushi has not only been a major importer of experimental dance, it has become a haven for local dance as well. The gallery began as a venue for performance art. But founding director Lynne Schuette added cutting-edge contemporary dance -- and reasonable rates for local dancers in need of performing space. Dance received another boost in 1984, when the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art threw its hat in the ring. Its Performance Parameters series spotlighted leading fringe artists in the museum's Sherwood Auditorium. Several local troupes have performed there and the museum has served as co-sponsor for several important events. Dance education has made enormous strides in the '80s at every level. From public schools to college degree programs, the availability of dance education has skyrocketed. The city now has two high schools devoted to the performing arts. SDSU has offered dance study throughout the decade. However, this year, the university approved a bachelor of arts degree in dance, which should be a magnet for attracting aspiring dancers to the area. United States International University has a strong dance and musical theater program, and the university's own dance troupe, established in 1987, performs here and in Mexico. UCSD's dance program does not offer a degree, but its contribution to the local scene has been significant, providing dancers and choreographers for many local companies. Dancers Workshop, the brainchild of Wendy Ellen Cochran, was founded in 1980 to import dancers from top New York companies for summer workshops with local dancers. Cochran's long association with ex-Martha Graham star Tim Wengerd brought dance students from around the country here to study. The San Diego Institute for Arts Education, a nonprofit organization founded in 1986 in response to cutbacks in arts funding in city and county schools, has introduced dance and other artistic disciplines to students of all levels. From 14 participating schools in its first year of programming, the institute has grown to service 26 schools, reaching 30,000 students.

Title: STAGE REVIEW; 'STARLIGHT EXPRESS' EXPLODES WITH PIZAZZ
Author: KENNETH HERMAN
Abstract: null
Text: Contrary to popular opinion, Andrew Lloyd Webber did not invent theatrical spectacle. He only appears to have been granted its current patent. Flornez Ziegfeld and Busby Berkeley built their careers on long-legged choreographic spectacle, and even the esteemed composers of Baroque opera knew a few attention-demanding stage tricks. In the 18th Century, entire scenes would descend from above the stage, accompanied by trumpets and drums, a feat that surprised and dazzled noble opera audiences of the pre-laser era. Wednesday at Civic Theatre, Lloyd Webber's cartoon musical "Starlight Express" both dazzled and delighted its opening-night audience. This touring production of the British composer's 1984 opus, presented by the San Diego Playgoers, imposed its high-tech identity on the staid hall. The oversized set overflowed the theater's stage area, replacing a section of front seats with a circular skating ramp, and the production brought along its own high-voltage power source for its mighty battery of lights and lasers. In "Starlight Express," Lloyd Webber metamorphosed his quirky "Cats" into a transcontinental train race and harnessed the inspirational horsepower of "The Little Engine That Could" to a crew of helmeted skaters. The story -- steam engine meets girl, steam engine loses girl, steam engine wins train race to win back girl -- is little more than an excuse for sleekly executed choreography on skates. (Arlene Phillips deserves high honors for her tight direction and brilliant choreography.) With its smoke, dancing spotlights, video sequences and smashing, industrial sculpture costumes, the musical is as visually stimulating as it is intellectually vapid. Always the clever chameleon, Lloyd Webber imitated or burlesqued a host of popular musical idioms, from the blues to 1940s swing harmonies to raucous 1950s rock 'n' roll. Nor was the composer above a cute country-Western takeoff or a hand-clapping gospel rip-off. Accompanied by a snappy, high-decibel 12-piece band in the pit -- no strings but lots of brass and multiple electronic keyboards -- the singers sang and skated in almost constant motion. Microphones attached to the skaters' helmets picked up their voices and amplified them to appropriate levels for a generation which has lost much of its hearing to heavy-metal rock concerts. Some voices stood out. As Rusty, the down-and-out steam engine (he's a bit rusty -- get it?) who acquires an infusion of self-confidence in order to win the race, Sean McDermott displayed a fine tenor instrument to grace the composer's more lyrical flights. Reva Rice, who sang Pearl, the girl Rusty finally wins back, mercilessly belted out her lyrics, although she wisely shifted gears to milk the audience's sympathy with her "I Don't Know How to Love Him" retread aria just before the finale. In the role of Poppa, Jimmy Lockett oozed infectious inspiration with his big gospel baritone. Ron DeVito merged macho bravado with an unassailable physical presence in the role of Greaseball, the diesel engine that runs on malice. He was no Sherrill Milnes, but then he didn't have to be. If composer Lloyd Webber occasionally succeeded at clever imitation, his lyricist Richard Stilgoe specialized in the humdrum. His hymn to mindless optimism that is the musical's grand finale, "Light at the End of the Tunnel," gives commonplace a new and more precise definition. By comparison, it makes Oscar Hammerstein's heart-clenching "You'll Never Walk Alone" seem like the Te Deum. This spiffy production, which plays through Dec. 31 at Civic Theatre, is highly recommended for children.

Title: JAZZ REVIEW; ALDEBERTS EXUDE SPECIAL CHARM
Author: LEONARD FEATHER
Abstract: null
Text: Monique and Louis Aldebert, on permanent loan from France for the past two decades, have become as familiar a part of the local landscape as the room that has been housing them lately, the Smoke House in Burbank. Their special brand of charm still has Gallic overtones, though at their first show Wednesday the Anglicization seemed to have been stretched a little too far. It was a welcome change of pace when they got around to singing "One Note Samba" in French. Nevertheless, the elegant essence remains: Monique Aldebert handles the lead role in her pure, gentle voice while her husband hums an occasional obbligato, joining her once in a while for a boppish unison, as in the wild and mostly wordless workout on Lester Young's "Tickle Toe." His main function is that of accompanist; in addition to furnishing sympathetic piano backing, he has sequenced certain passages that enabled him to simulate an orchestra with useful synth effects. If there were problems with the amplification, was it ever any other way in a typical restaurant experimenting with music? The synth was helpful in establishing a mood on "Try to Remember." The Aldeberts reversed their roles as Louis took over the lead voice for their own composition "Home Is Where the Heart Is." Another, newer original, "Music Is a Love Affair," reflected their special talents in the creation of music and English lyrics. Understatement has always been a keynote of the Aldeberts' offerings. If this means they are swimming against the tide, so be it; too often on today's vocal scene the waves in the other direction seem overwhelming. They close Saturday at the Smoke House but will continue their other gig, working Thursdays through Sundays from 3 to 7 p.m. in the Observation Bar aboard the Queen Mary in Long Beach.

Title: RAISING A TOAST TO THE NEW YEAR WITH A UNIQUE PRESENTATION OF STRAUSS' 'DIE FLEDERMAUS' ; MUSIC: SAN DIEGO IS AWASH IN HOLIDAY TUNES. THE DIAMOND JUBILEE OF BALBOA PARK'S SPRECKELS ORGAN WILL BE LAUNCHED WITH TWO CONCERTS NEW YEAR'S EVE.
Author: KENNETH HERMAN
Abstract: null
Text: It's no mystery why Johann Strauss' frothy operetta "Die Fledermaus" -- with its nonstop party pranks and champagne toasts -- is the evergreen favorite to stage on New Year's Eve. West Coast Lyric Opera, San Diego's shoestring semi-professional company, will carry on the tradition locally with a unique "Die Fledermaus" staged in the round at Hillcrest's Words and Music book gallery Sunday at 8 p.m. According to Anne Young, the company's director and musical organizer of this production, the custom of mounting "Die Fledermaus" on New Year's Eve is a revered Viennese tradition. "There is nothing in the libretto per se that links the story to New Year's Eve," said Young. "But the concert that takes place in the ball scene during the opera's second act always invites 'surprise' guest appearances that take on the character of a party caper." "Le Reveillon," the popular French farce on which Strauss based "Die Fledermaus," however, is set on Christmas Eve in 19th-Century Paris. Before Strauss could compose his effervescent score, the French libretto (by Meilhac and Halevy, Bizet's librettists for "Carmen") was given a German translation and cultural transformation to the Vienna of 1874. The composer premiered "Die Fledermaus" to an approving Viennese audience in April, 1874, and with its even more successful return the following season, it became a staple of the Vienna stage. Young's cast of youthful singers for this weekend's performance of "Die Fledermaus" includes sopranos LeAnn Sandel and Dawn Veree Harrison as Rosalinda and Adele, respectively; tenor Steven Williams as the dashing Alfred, and tenor Daniel Leal as Eisenstein. Mezzo-soprano Ava Estis will sing the pants role of Prince Orlofsky, whose lavish party is the setting for most of the operetta. For information concerning this performance, which will be surrounded by a catered dinner, dancing, and a reprise of the operetta's champagne toast at midnight, call 298-4011. New Year's Eve is associated locally with the anniversary of the opening of the Panama-California Exposition on Dec. 31, 1914. Among the Balboa Park institutions that date from the 1915 exposition, whose ornate Spanish Colonial buildings still give the park its architectural identity, the Spreckels Organ will observe 75th anniversary festivities throughout the coming year. Sunday, civic organist Robert Plimpton will play two programs to launch the organ's diamond jubilee. At 2 p.m., Plimpton will perform music associated with Balboa Park, including organ solos by the city's former civic organists, Humphrey Stewart (the Englishman who was San Diego's first civic organist), Royal Brown, and Charles Shatto. Plimpton, who has been civic organist since January, 1985, plays his recitals every Sunday afternoon throughout the year. This Sunday's offerings will include Balboa Park audience favorites such as Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor and Mulet's "Thou art the Rock." Soprano Pamela Anne Maran will join Plimpton to sing a number of popular songs from 1915, including the song that was the Panama-California Exposition's theme song, a work Plimpton unearthed in the archives of the San Diego Historical Society. At 11:30 p.m., Plimpton will give a short organ recital that will end just before midnight, when a brief ceremony will mark the precise moment of the exposition's 75th anniversary.

Title: THE GALLERIES: WEST LOS ANGELES
Author: SUZANNE MUCHNIC
Abstract: null
Text: Two dozen carnival masks from the tiny West African country of Guinea Bissau are temporary residents in Ernie Wolfe's unconventional outpost of ethnic art. The gallery has housed a fantastic jungle of painted metal plants -- not to mention shows of Polish and Soviet art -- but it has never topped the current assembly of masks. Measuring up to 5 feet tall and displayed on posts so that they loom above our heads, the masks are a wondrous and terrifying forest of weird faces that threaten to eat visitors alive. Painter Ed Moses has provided a suitably ominous background of dripped pigment on dark canvas. Wolfe, who travels widely and has a penchant for ethnic art that you won't find in coffeetable books, bought all the masks from young men who wore them in a pre-Lenten parade last spring. Made of papier-mache over clay molds, the brightly painted masks are typically destroyed or discarded after the annual parades. This show is likely the first American exhibition of carnival masks from Guinea Bissau. Are they great art? Not in terms of refinement, but the masks are extraordinarily expressive. While each is an individual creation, the faces share ghoulish grins, sharp fangs, curled horns and big, pointed ears. Little people and animals often sprout on the tops of the giant heads. Human hands sometimes emerge from the masks' hungry mouths. Two themes apparently dominated the 1989 parade: health and world peace. A bright-blue condom is displayed on one mask, while another boasts a little doctor with his medical kit. The piece de resistance, however, is a mean, toothy face that sprouts a veritable tower of peace. A nude male figure standing on the mask balances the star of Guinea Bissau and a white dove on his head while he waves Soviet and U.S. flags.

Title: THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA
Author: MARLENA DONOHUE
Abstract: null
Text: An inaugural exhibit of a new gallery features Lawrence Weiner who helped spearhead the late '60s conceptual art movement with his fragments of text painted on walls. Here, the phrase "assuming the position" is enclosed in a handsome graphic logo of black lines and silver strips. The design and words are repeated on each gallery wall with opposing phrases, such as put together and spread apart or tossed aside and carried along printed above and below. The installation reads like a refresher course on conceptual art, and that's not so bad since the movement is at the core of everything from happenings to environmental art to Joseph Beuys' work. By pitting obvious conceptual dichotomies around the written litany "assume the position," Weiner recalls conceptualism's key idea that art is not the production of salable objects but the process by which the artist formulates creative options and the viewer invests these with meaning. Weiner's text is intentionally drained of personal and art historical cues so that ideally each viewer has a pure, unguided and unique reaction. This renders value judgments of good or bad and issues of taste meaningless in defining what counts as art. Further, Weiner's transitory media -- the gallery walls will be eventually whitewashed -- remind us that the materials of art are also not what defines the presence of art. Art is the creative impulse. This isn't new. When Duchamp made art of a bicycle wheel he was making a similar point. And Weiner's philosophy suffers from the same ironic twist noted by Duchamp when he said, "I throw a urinal in their faces and they admire it for its beauty." By its very presentation in a gallery setting, by its very authorship by a noted and vocal conceptualist, we're predisposed to look for certain cadence and meaning consistent with Weiner's intent. The good news is that we find it, and it enlightens us about the process of perceiving meaning in art. The bad news is exactly what conceptualism hoped to avoid: If we're not privy to certain information, the words can hang as meaningless as billboard gibberish. (Stuart Regen Gallery, 619 N.

Title: ETHNIC EATING: SHANGRI-LA: A SUMPTUOUS NEW OUTPOST OF CHINESE CUISINE
Author: BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: The newest of the sumptuous Hong Kong style-restaurants is not in Chinatown or Monterey Park. Shangri-La can be found at Boylston and 3rd streets. You can't miss it. Neon signs banded around the top of the low, curving building announce this outpost of Chinese cuisine. Inside, the view of the surrounding high-rise structures makes a striking backdrop to the midday fleet of dim-sum carts. Aside from dim sum, Shangri-La specializes in seafood. The best dish that I encountered was a striking presentation of skewered shrimp taken fresh from the restaurant's tanks, cooked, and doused with dark garlic sauce. The sauce was wonderful to eat with the accompanying bowl of rice noodles. Plump shrimp daubed with mayonnaise and paired with crisp, sesame sprinkled candied walnuts offered an interesting play of textures. And a collection of seafood -- shrimp, scallops and sea cucumber -- heaped in a potato basket was fine. So were deep-fried flounder slices seasoned with spicy salt -- although what the restaurant means by spicy salt escapes me. I've had two dishes with that ingredient -- the other was sliced pork loin -- and neither was what I would call spicy. I'm not an oyster fan, but I loved a dish of braised oysters. The plump mollusks were spooned sizzling onto a hot platter and topped with a fruity dark sauce. Crisp on the outside, they were mellow and tender within. A Chinese friend admired the simple perfection of a steamed whole small tilapia and liked a soup made with whole shark fins and chicken. It takes special skill, he said, to cook the fins so they don't fall apart in shreds. The soup came in a small, covered pot and included a portion of fin and a bony chunk of chicken that the waitress divested of meat with chopsticks. The broth is dark and murky but full of flavor. This is not a pretty dish. Looks are not generally disregarded here, however, and the kitchen can turn out colorful platters of food. Stir-fried spinach with garlic and Chinese sausage, for example, came ringed with orange slices, their aroma released by the heat of the platter. I've had a few failed dishes here as well, including tough slices of boiled geoduck and an odd dish that combined tender scallops with leather-hard slices of sea conch. The only problem I've had with dim sum was being seated in a non-smoking area and waiting in vain for the carts. The waitress explained that the area had been set aside for customers ordering from the full menu. (No smoking, no dim sum?) On other days, I went through quite an assortment, including velvety beef balls, steamed buns filled with chicken, pork or lotus paste, crunchy browned squares of shrimp toast and a lotus leaf-wrapped bundle of sticky rice mixed with lotus seeds, Chinese sausage and barbecued pork. I loved hom shi gok, a thick, faintly sweet, rice flour cake stuffed with meat and fried until golden brown. And I enjoyed the impromptu language lesson imparted by "fungus pork in rice noodle." There was no fungus inside the wrapper. The word simply sounds like a Cantonese word that describes a filling composed of pork, shrimp and vegetables. Most of the dim sum is $1.60 a plate, with higher prices for special items. The restaurant has a fax-a-lunch menu with prices for main dishes ranging from $5 to $6.50. The selection sticks to such familiar items as beef with broccoli, kung po shrimp and sweet and sour pork. Dinner menu prices are higher. The steamed small tilapia is $10, the shark's fin and chicken soup is $18, and the shrimp on skewers cost $16 a pound, plus $2 for the accompanying rice noodles. Shangri-La Chinese Seafood Restaurant, 313 S. Boylston St., Los Angeles. (213) 250-2288. Open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.-9:30 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m.-9:30 p.m. American Express, Visa and MasterCard accepted. Validated parking in rooftop garage (enter on 4th Street).

Title: HOME TECH: VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW; A PREVIEW OF COMING VCR ATTRACTIONS
Author: TERRY ATKINSON
Abstract: null
Text: In the post-Christmas tradition, video companies aren't releasing much of interest the week after the big holiday. So to keep your spirits up, let's first consider coming attractions. In early 1990, you'll be able to rent or buy: "License to Kill" (videocassette, Jan. 4), "Parenthood" (videocassette and videodisc, Feb. 8), "Batman" (videodisc, Feb. 8), "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (videocassette and videodisc, Feb. 1), "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" (videocassette -- which includes the Roger Rabbit short "Tummy Trouble" -- March 16 and priced at $22.99), "Lethal Weapon 2" (videocassette and videodisc, Feb. 8), "Do the Right Thing" (videocassette, Jan. 11). Also: "New York Stories" (videocassette, Jan. 24), "Pink Cadillac" (videocassette, Jan. 10), "Turner and Hooch" (videocassette, Jan. 24), "Uncle Buck" (videocassette Jan. 25, videodisc Feb. 1), "Karate Kid III" (videocassette, Jan. 24), "The Abyss" (videocassette, March 29), "Wired" (videocassette, Feb. 8), "The Package" (videocassette and videodisc, Feb. 22) and several Andy Hardy films (videocassette, Jan. 23). And now for this week's new videos: Think what you will of colorization, "The Big Sky" (Turner, $19.98, not MPAA rated) is one of those old films that practically begs for it. Ted Turner, naturally, has obliged -- but a black-and-white version is also out. Dudley Nichols adapted the A. B. Guthrie, Jr. novel about an old-West expedition up the Missouri, Howard Hawks directed robustly and Kirk Douglas plays the lead heartily. The trouble with "Weekend at Bernie's" (IVE, $89.95, R) is that it's not "The Trouble With Harry." Hitchcock's "Harry" was a frequently delightful attempt at concocting black humor out of a plot centered around a dead body; "Weekend" doesn't handle this tricky business nearly as well, but the 1989 comedy, starring Andrew McCarthy, had its supporters. Martin Sheen, Tony Musante and Donna Mills made their feature-film debuts in "The Incident" (CBS/Fox, $59.98), a 1967 drama about two punks who terrorize passengers on a New York subway. Malcolm McDowell and Madolyn Smith star in the otherwise obscure 1987 suspense film "The Caller" (TWE, $89.95, R), a battle of wills between two strangers. Cheryl Ladd, Stuart Wilson and John Gielgud star in the 1989 made-for-TV drama "Romance on the Orient Express" (Turner, $69.98). OTHER NEW VIDEOS Work off those extra holiday pounds with "The Sports Illustrated Super Shape-Up Program" (HBO, $19.99 each for three 50-minute tapes) or "Body and Mind" (HBO, $29.99), a 70-minute "total relaxation and stress-relief program" featuring Raquel Welch and Dr. Joan Borysenko.

Title: ART REVIEW; 'SECRETS' LOOKS AT FREEDOM THROUGH THE ROSENBERG CASE
Author: KRISTINE MCKENNA
Abstract: null
Text: The 1953 executions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg aren't In "Unknown Secrets: Art and the Rosenberg Era," on view at Otis/Parsons Art Gallery through Jan. 6, 49 artists commemorate Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed as spies in 1953. The exhibition reminds us of how terribly fragile freedom is. Curated by Nina Felshin, "Unknown Secrets" will travel to eight U.S. cities over a period of 2 1/2 years; it's heartening to know that this comprehensive and important exhibition will be seen by so many. Married and the parents of two young children, the Rosenbergs were a middle-class couple from New York's Lower East Side who were arrested in 1951 and convicted of leaking secrets pertaining to atomic weapons to the Soviets. Ethel's younger brother, David Greenglass, who was also under suspicion, turned the couple in to save his own neck and was instrumental in sending them to the electric chair. The case inspired countless investigations, poems, plays, films, novels, stories and songs, and "Unknown Secrets," accompanied by an in-depth catalogue, attempts to acknowledge all of it. In addition to the Rosenbergs, this ambitious show explores several related themes, including authority, history, memory, censorship, the arms race, the right to dissent, capital punishment, anti-Semitism, espionage and anti-communism. Of 60 works in the show, 60% are contemporary works made at the invitation of the show's curator, while the rest are historical works created as a form of protest at the time of the incident. Vintage works include pieces by Fernand Leger, Alice Neel, Arnold Mesches and Mort Dimondstein, a lithograph by Picasso made to help raise funds for the Rosenberg defense, and woodcuts -- one of which depicts Ethel burning at the stake -- by Rockwell Kent. Made during the height of the Abstract Expressionist movement, political art of this sort was considered a secondary form at the time. Catalogue essayist Paul Von Blum offers an explanation for that with the suggestion that Abstract Expressionism came into vogue and outdistanced topical art during this paranoid period partly because there was nothing overtly political about it. Of the recent work, Sue Coe's "Needs of the State" stands out as a high point of the show. One of the most hard-hitting political artists working today ("Porkopolis," her new body of work indicting the meat-packing industry, drew rave reviews during a recent New York showing), Coe has a created a dark, nightmarish image that finds a man with the word truth emblazoned on his chest frying in the electric chair. A gallery of prominent figures -- among them Einstein, Picasso and Lillian Hellman -- await execution. Robert Arneson shows bronze busts of the Rosenbergs with 2 fried commie jew spies tattooed on their foreheads, while Peter Saul offers a lurid portrait of Ethel in the electric chair. Dennis Adams installed blow-ups of news photos of the Rosenbergs and their tormentors (McCarthy, prosecuting attorney Roy Cohn, Eisenhower) in New York bus shelters, while Leon Marcus shows a portrait of Cohn cast as Judas. The fact that the Rosenbergs refused to plead guilty made them political fanatics in the eyes of the press, but they maintained their innocence to the end. Supporting them at the time were most influential European thinkers, who were united in their belief that the Rosenbergs were innocent.

Title: ART REVIEW; 'HIGH ROAD': PICTURES OF A SOCIAL DILEMMA; PHOTOGRAPHY: SAN DIEGO EXHIBITION DETAILS LIFE AMONG THE HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS ALONG THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER -- AND THE DISPARITY HAS NEVER SEEMED MORE DISTURBING.
Author: CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: A paved high road curves through manicured landscaping to a sprawling ranch house. The low road is dirt, and there are no homes in sight. The high road serves the upper-middle-class residents of Rancho Bernardo; the low road is a dusty path an immigrant laborer takes to bring drinkable water to his encampment. He and the unseen homeowner are neighbors, uneasily coexisting in an atmosphere of fear, desperation, denial and deeply ingrained prejudice. Don Bartletti's photograph "High Road/Low Road" is part of an eye-opening photo-documentation of life at the Mexico-U.S. border, commissioned by the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego and supported by the Los Angeles Times, San Diego Edition and the Times Mirror Foundation. On view at the museum through Jan. 7, "Los Vecinos" (The Neighbors) consists of images made by four American and three Mexican photographers, as well as documentary videos by two San Diegans. Subjects are diverse: the rituals of Latino gang members, tactics of the U.S. Border Patrol, small moments in immigrant workers' daily lives, street children and the tourist trade in Tijuana. The photographers' approaches are intensely personal. And the social crisis of Us and Them has never seemed more disturbing and despairing of remedy. Anyone familiar with images of migrant workers in the Dust Bowl taken by the Farm Security Administration photographers will observe that documentary photography has changed a great deal since the 1930s, when the best work aspired to the ennobled, exalted status of Renaissance painting. A good number of the photographs in "Los Vecinos" are in the blurred or random-seeming "snapshot" style that has been the fashion for the past couple of decades. Scattered, dimly lit images give the flavor of life on the run and the scrounging life of the streets. The more judgmental images tend to be more rigorously composed, more "journalistic," more able to convey the bones of a narrative. Susan Meiselas, known for her reportorial photographs of Nicaragua and El Salvador, chose to focus on what one member of the Border Patrol calls "the ultimate game hunt." In one of her images, a beefy guard with a holster holds a suspected illegal immigrant by the back of his shirt. Meiselas slices their heads off the top of the print, stripping off both their personalities to zero in on the symbolism of hunter and hunted. Liliana Nieto del Rio, a staff photographer for New York Newsday, looks at the hard-bitten, scruffy bits of everyday life in camps on the banks of the Tijuana River. Carpet scraps, comic books, cigarette packets and dirt, endless dirt, are the interior decoration of this environment. For amusement, a young boy aims a BB rifle at U.S. border guards who are small specks in the distance. A street kid in Tijuana makes goofy faces inside an abandoned car; others gather in bare rooms to sniff paint thinner or glue. Antonio Turok, a self-taught magazine photographer in Mexico, offers a kaleidoscope of views of the refugee camp life in Mexico. A child's skin hangs in frightening folds from her legs. A tearful group of men and boys (where are the women?) grieve at the fringes of a child's coffin. A barefoot man in a suit lifts his hat to a covey of middle-class schoolgirls in parochial school uniforms. Pablo Ortiz Monasterio, an award-winning Mexican photographer, locates small, mostly upbeat, moments in immigrant life: the bed as a central gathering place in a household that may not own any other furniture, the spic-and-span white dresses of young girls, children's hands laboring over a crayon drawing of a religious shrine. Elizabeth Sisco has devoted her career to photographing life at the border. Her installation contains cheery color photographs of Tijuana vendors, shelves of their cheap wares, black-and-white candid shots of strolling tourists -- and a sampling of their devastatingly insular and callous remarks. ("They are not the people I'd like to see everyday," sniffs one visitor.) Bartletti, a Los Angeles Times photographer, is a succinct storyteller alert to the meaningfulness of detail. A row of Guatemalan refugees wrapped in blankets sleep above a freeway ribboned with bright car lights. Other Guatemalans -- one carrying a native embroidered bag, another holding a plastic sack -- stride through a field at dawn, rushing to street corners miles away where they hope to be hired as day-laborers. Graciela Iturbide, a disciple of the great Mexican photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo, offers images of young barrio society in East Los Angeles: the hand signals, the stylized modes of dress, the tattooed and painted decorations found on bare skin, religious murals and car hoods. A young woman sitting wistfully in the back seat of a car with her baby is made up like a movie goddess, her painstaking self-adornment radiating a vibrancy and sensuality that floats above the decay of her surroundings. There is no violence in Iturbide's photographs, only bravado and sadness. There wasn't enough time on one visit to absorb some six hours of videotapes by Paul Espinosa, a senior producer at KPBS-TV, and Louis Hock, a professor in the UC San Diego visual arts department. But Hock's "Mexican Tapes: A Chronicle of Life Outside the Law," offers a disarmingly low-key introduction to three families of undocumented Mexicans he came to know as neighbors and followed through five years of wonder, dismay and wariness as they learned about life on the other side of the border.

Text: City officials say inspectors have found safety violations in half the high-rise construction cranes operating in San Francisco a month after a crane collapse killed five people. California Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspectors have ordered five cranes shut down until violations were corrected. Two other cranes were found to be in proper order, while the other three cranes in use at high-rise construction sites have yet to be inspected, officials said. Mayor Art Agnos, who requested Cal/OSHA to do the inspections after the Nov. 28 disaster, promised to seek stricter supervision of the machines, warning careless operators that "we're coming after you." He said he will tell other mayors throughout the state of the result of the inspections and hoped that together they could pressure the state Legislature for stricter regulation.

Text: A judge, overturning a jury verdict, has awarded $1.8 million to a former top-level official with the city of Santa Ana who claimed that he was fired because of his age and his efforts to expose wrongdoing in city hiring, the fired official said. Donald Bott, 55, of San Clemente, now interim personnel chief for the city of El Segundo, had asserted that Santa Ana city officials laid him off four years ago because he refused to "play ball" in tolerating alleged mismanagement and favoritism in city practices. Six months ago, an Orange County Superior Court jury refused to award Bott damages as a result of his dismissal during a budget crunch after 17 years as director of personnel. But Judge Leonard Goldstein agreed to reconsider that decision, signaling that he found merit in Bott's claim.

Title: WHERE IS $9.99-MILLION LOTTO WINNER?
Author: RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: Somebody, presumably a North County resident, either stands to become a millionaire or suffer the most crushing loss in the five-year history of the state lottery. Whoever bought a Lotto ticket at an Encinitas supermarket on Dec. 20 and picked the numbers 44-14-23-27-21-12 has won $9.99 million but has not yet contacted lottery officials to claim the prize. "There really is no way to track the person," lottery spokeswoman Carolyn Walker said Thursday. "You don't have to sign any register or anything when you buy the ticket, so we have no way of seeking people out." If the winner doesn't appear, the erstwhile wealth will be returned to the prize pool for someone else to win. In this case, it would be the biggest sum that slipped away since the Lottery began in 1985. "It's only happened a couple of times before," Walker said. In June, 1988, a winning ticket in Hawthorne went unclaimed and $4.7 million went back into the kitty. So, too, in January, 1987, when a ticket purchased in San Francisco's Chinatown was never turned in and somebody lost $3.9 million. "We never heard from them," said Walker. Some overnight millionaires can't wait to let the world know they've gone warp speed into a new tax bracket. "We get people who call the press before it (the winning ticket) gets validated," said Walker. Just as typically, though, people either don't immediately know they have a lucky ticket or choose to bide their time before they step into the limelight. "This time of year, the person could be on vacation or any number of things like that. It's hard to know," said Walker. "We did have someone, not long ago, wait a couple of weeks. First, he talked to his tax person and a financial adviser and did some planning." The $9.99-million winner, who beat one-in-14 million odds, still has time to come forward, as the lottery allows 180 days from the draw before a ticket must be surrendered. Whomever bought the $1 ticket from the Alpha Beta store on El Camino in Encinitas would receive, after 20% is deducted for taxes, an annual $400,000 check for 20 years.

Title: MAN SLAIN BY EX-WIFE AFTER BREAKING INTO EL CAJON HOME
Author: CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: An El Cajon man was fatally shot when he attempted to attack his ex-wife in her home, El Cajon police said Thursday. Edward Mendidles Jr., 42, was shot once in the chest Wednesday night with a .38-caliber revolver and died a short time later at Sharp Memorial Hospital, police spokeswoman Julie Palos said. His ex-wife, Linda Sharon Minear, was questioned by police and released, Palos said. At 6:47 p.m., officers responded to a report of shots being fired at a home in the 1400 block of Naranca Avenue, Palos said. They found Mendidles lying on the floor with a bullet wound in his chest, she said. Minear told police that she shot Mendidles when he broke down her back door and came toward her making threats, Palos said. Minear told police that her 1966 marriage to Mendidles ended in 1968, and they did not speak to each other until last June, when Mendidles called and asked her on a date, Palos said. During their new courtship, Minear said that Mendidles drank heavily and abused her. Although Minear filed and later dropped an assault with a deadly weapon complaint against Mendidles in October, he moved into her El Cajon home earlier this month, Palos said. Minear told police that on the day of the shooting Mendidles was drinking heavily and she locked him out of the house because she believed her life was in danger, Palos said. An autopsy and toxicological tests will be performed.

Title: PERSISTENT FATHER FINDS SUSPECT IN SON'S DEATH; CRIME: A GRIEVING MAN'S INVESTIGATION CONVINCES POLICE THAT SON'S DEATH WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT. OFFICERS ARREST A TRANSIENT.
Author: AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: Skeptical of the police conclusion that his son's death was an accident, a grieving father conducted his own investigation that led to the arrest of a 37-year-old transient on suspicion of murdering the son by injecting him with heroin. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in San Fernando Superior Court for John Bird on charges that he murdered Rocco Froio, 32, with an injection while Froio was asleep or unconscious. Authorities said Bird's arrest was due to the efforts of Froio's father, Richard Froio, 50, of Los Angeles, who launched his own campaign to uncover the truth about the death of his son, an alcoholic who lived on the streets. Rocco Froio's body was discovered on Aug. 18 in bushes near Laurel Canyon and Ventura boulevards in Studio City. After an autopsy revealed that Froio had died of a heroin overdose, Los Angeles detectives ruled the death accidental and closed the case. But his father had suspicions. Although he had trouble with drugs in the past, Rocco Froio had not used any for seven years, said Detective Charles Barnes. Barnes said the coroner's report found only one puncture mark and no sign of any recent drug use. Richard Froio posted a sign near the place his son's body was discovered, asking for information about his death. He received several phone calls from homeless people who said Bird had injected Froio with heroin while the man was asleep or passed out, drunk. Richard Froio talked to a witness on the phone and in person, then took the information to the police, who arrested Bird on Oct. 21. "He was very dedicated and instrumental in the case," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Guadalupe Y. Gonzalez, who is prosecuting the case. "The sign kept getting knocked down and he would pass by it and put it up again. He wandered around and talked to people, asking them if they knew his son. He was trying to reconstruct his son's last moments." Richard Froio was in San Fernando Court Thursday, waiting for the preliminary hearing -- which was postponed -- but he declined to comment on his investigation of his son's death. Rocco Froio has a widow and three children who are deeply saddened by the death, he said. Barnes said police are investigating the possibility that Bird wanted Froio dead because Froio had overheard comments linking Bird to criminal activity. Barnes would not elaborate. Bird was charged with murder and with the sale and transportation of heroin. The key witnesses in the preliminary hearing are expected to be three homeless people who were at the scene of Froio's death. But Gonzalez said she did not anticipate problems with her witnesses. "I don't think their credibility should be impaired because they are at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale," she said. If Bird is convicted on both counts, he faces a maximum sentence of 30 years to life in prison.

Title: DEATH OF FAN AFTER ARREST AT CONCERT IS RULED A HOMICIDE; POLICE: INGLEWOOD OFFICIALS DENY WRONGDOING. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE SAYS THERE IS A "POSSIBILITY THAT CRIMINAL CHARGES WILL BE ISSUED."
Author: MARC LACEY and DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS
Abstract: null
Text: A coroner's autopsy released Thursday found that the death of a college student, who was forcibly arrested outside a Grateful Dead concert at the Forum earlier this month, resulted from "compression of the neck during restraint," authorities said. Witnesses at the scene said they saw Inglewood police officers beating Patrick Shanahan, 19, of Fountain Valley with their night sticks as they arrested him after a Dec. 10 concert. But police spokesmen, who refused to comment on the ruling Thursday, denied that officers either struck Shanahan or used excessive force and contended that he probably died of a drug overdose. "The mode of death is homicide," said David Campbell, supervising investigator with the Los Angeles County coroner's office. "It's not an accident, not a suicide, it's a homicide -- meaning death at the hands of another." Campbell said Shanahan died from a "compression of the neck during restraint" in addition to "multiple injuries and acute LSD intoxication." "This entire incident has been a nightmare for us," said Shanahan's father, William, who is executive director of the 1,500-member Garden Grove Educators Assn. "My beautiful 19-year-old son is dead. . . . I am too numb to be angry." Patrick Shanahan was buried Dec. 22 in New Hampshire, where the Shanahans lived before coming to Southern California. Conceding that Shanahan experimented with marijuana but disputing his use of harder drugs, family members have hired an attorney, a private pathologist and an investigator to look into the case. Meanwhile, the district attorney's office is investigating the case, and there is a "possibility that criminal charges will be issued," spokesman Mike Botula said Thursday. Inglewood police officials indicated earlier this month that they were conducting a routine internal investigation of the incident. Shanahan, who attended UC Santa Barbara, was pronounced dead at 10:48 p.m. at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, where doctors ruled the preliminary cause of death was a drug overdose. Inglewood Police Sgt. Harold Moret said Shanahan had been spotted by police on his hands and knees on a ramp leading up to the Forum "screaming at imaginary people and saying things that indicated he was completely out of it." When police tried to arrest him for public intoxication, Shanahan began kicking, biting and punching the officers, Moret said. Dozens of people witnessed the scuffle. Eventually, the officers tied his ankles with a nylon rope and handcuffed him. He was carried to a police car, where officers discovered he had stopped breathing. One of the witnesses to the Shanahan arrest, Neal Bridgnell, 25, a student at Cal State Long Beach, said he was drawn to the scene by loud screams. "We asked a girl what was going on and she said the cops were beating this guy to death," Bridgnell said. Bridgnell's girlfriend, Christine Smitts, said police were standing in a semi-circle around Shanahan hitting him with their night sticks. Another witness, a 24-year-old Venice woman, said: "We saw six big men, all police, coming from two sides. They kept hitting him with their billy clubs. We wanted to know why they were beating him so, but a security guard pushed us back and told us to go our own way."

Title: STATE ALLOWS LAWNDALE TO OK NEW BUILDINGS UNDER OLD ZONING LAW
Author: HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: State officials have given development in Lawndale a green light by allowing the city to issue building permits for one year under a 1976 General Plan that was invalidated by voters in November. The decision by the state Office of Planning and Research alleviates a serious development problem that arose when voters rejected the city's 1976 General Plan, which governs all zoning and development in the city. The issue was put on the ballot to resolve a controversy over the validity of the 1976 plan. The vote left Lawndale without a valid General Plan and, as a result, city officials temporarily stopped issuing o building permits. State law requires cities to have an up-to-date General Plan before they can issue building permits. Lawndale officials have been developing a new General Plan, but it is not finished. Jack Ferguson, a principal planner with the state office, said the director of planning and research decided last Friday to temporarily allow the city to issue building permits under the 1976 General Plan to give city officials time to prepare an up-to-date plan for voter consideration. He said the state usually gives such temporary relief to cities that have just been incorporated and have yet to approve a General Plan. He said the dilemma surrounding Lawndale's General Plan is unusual. "We don't run across that every day," he said. Ferguson said a letter was sent last week to City Atty. David Aleshire, notifying the city that the state had approved its application to continue issuing building permits under the 1976 General Plan. But, because Aleshire is on vacation until Jan. 2, most city officials learned about the decision in calls this week from reporters. City officials expressed surprise at the swiftness of the state's decision and relief that city development can continue. "I'm just glad we don't have to wait any longer, and we can go ahead and do business," said Councilman Larry Rudolph. City Manager Jim Arnold said he was happy to hear about the state's decision but said he has yet to receive official notice. "It's good news, but it's difficult to comment because I don't know what kind of conditions" the state has imposed, he said. According to Ferguson, the city must adhere to one condition: In order to approve discretionary measures -- such as rezoning applications, special-use permits and zoning variances -- the city must make a written finding that the measures will be consistent with the General Plan and current zoning. "I think we can live with that," Rudolph said of the conditions. The state's decision apparently also gave the go-ahead to a new set of condominium building standards, whose approval had prompted some protest earlier this month from Mayor Sarann Kruse and Councilwoman Carol Norman. On Dec. 7 the City Council approved the application, asking the state to temporarily continue issuing building permits based on the zoning standards of the 1976 General Plan. Included in that application was the condominium standards, which were designed to encourage the building of condominiums as a replacement for the city's aging apartment stock. The standards would eliminate the required minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet for condominiums. Instead, the minimum lot size for apartments would apply, giving builders the option of putting condominiums on lots where the only alternative had been apartments or single-family dwellings. Kruse and Norman objected to including the revised condominium standards in the application, saying the city had advertised the wrong date for the hearing on them. Kruse insisted the standards would "significantly impact the city" and said an accurately publicized hearing is needed on the issue. Kruse was out of town this week and could not be reached for comment. In an interview Thursday, Norman said she is "very disappointed" that the condominium standards were not rejected by the state. "It may end up in litigation again," she warned. Some residents objected to the revised standards, saying they are inconsistent with the 1976 General Plan, which set the minimum condominium lot size at 10,000 square feet. Ferguson said the state included the condominium standards in its approval but did not specifically address the debate about whether an accurately publicized hearing was required before the council approved the standards. He said the state also is permitting the City Council to decide whether the revised standards are consistent with the General Plan. "We are going to leave it up to the city to make those decisions," he said. In an interview earlier this month, Assistant Atty. Gen. Allan Ashby had agreed the condominium standards may be challenged in court because they were approved without an accurately publicized hearing. He said a judge could find the standards invalid because a publicized hearing was not held. Steve Mino, a vocal opponent of the condominium standards, said he objects because the standards will allow developers to overbuild small lots and "take the lawn out of Lawndale." He would not rule out filing a lawsuit against the city. Rudolph -- who submitted the condominium standards covering all multifamily residential zones -- has supported the standards, saying they will spur renewal of the city's dilapidated apartments.

Title: WEEKENDER: THEATER GROUP TO RING IN THE NEW YEAR BY TURNING BACK THE CLOCK
Author: Gerald Faris What: New Year's Eve "Biloxi Blues." When: Sunday, 8 p.m.-midnight. Where: Theatre Arts Conservatory, 1233 Hermosa Ave., Hermosa Beach. Admission: $15 donation; $25 per couple. Information: 372-6604; 548-5798.
Abstract: null
Text: The new decade of the '90s is about to make its appearance. But a nonprofit theater group new to Hermosa Beach will turn the clock back to the 1940s in a New Year's Eve party Sunday evening. No champagne corks will pop. Rather, a cast assembled by the Theatre Arts Conservatory will perform Neil Simon's autobiographical play, "Biloxi Blues." After the 8 p.m. play, there will be a buffet and dancing in light reflected by a mirrored globe until everyone welcomes 1990 at midnight. The celebration will take its cue from the play, in which embryonic writer Eugene Jerome -- Neil Simon's fictional alter ego -- comes of age while undergoing the indignities of a World War II boot camp in Mississippi. "It'll be like a big USO party," said Nancy L. Campbell, artistic director of the conservatory, which has turned a lofty, one-time newspaper office in the Bijou Twin Theatres building into a theater. Everyone is encouraged to wear 1940s clothes, and dancing will be to recorded big band music of the World War II era. A $15 donation will be requested. Campbell expects that many who show up will remember her group from its theatrical wanderings around the South Bay, including stints at the Art Deco-style Warner Grand Theater in San Pedro and the one-time Princess Louise floating restaurant in Los Angeles Harbor. The group has been dormant for a year. "We want to introduce ourselves to Hermosa Beach, to let people know we're alive and kicking," she said, explaining that the evening is a benefit for the new venture, which so far has been financed largely by donations from the group's board of directors. The low platform stage, with a long black drape as a backdrop, has that stark barracks look with metal bunks borrowed from the youth hostel at Angel's Gate Park in San Pedro. Some of the cast members made the wooden military footlockers, and olive drab is the dominant costume color. Daily rehearsals have been under way for three weeks, and Campbell said that by Sunday, the ensemble will be ready. "In the last week, a lot of magic happens," she said. The cast, most of them new to Campbell's group, includes community theater graduates, as well as actors with credits in dinner theater, modeling, commercials and television. At 15, Janet Gassmann already is a veteran of commercials and modeling and has had roles in two miniseries and an Orange County dinner theater production of "The Sound of Music." She plays the girl Eugene falls in love with at a USO dance in "Biloxi Blues." Skip Tucker, who plays the drill sergeant, calls the cast "a good ensemble. It's a family, rather than a group rehearsing a play." Campbell said her performers are people addicted to theater even when making their livings doing something else: "They have a lot of pictures and resumes out." A native of Los Angeles, Campbell began dancing at the age of 3 and once understudied child star Deanna Durbin. She later lived in New York and worked as an actress there for many years before returning to California. Campbell's group has had several homes since she organized it in 1983 as a combination acting school and performing company. At the Warner Grand, the group did "Bus Stop" and had a three-month run in "Hot l Baltimore." When it presented dinner theater on the Princess Louise, its playhouse was the old captain's ballroom. "The dance floor was our stage," Campbell said. "The restaurant fed 'em and we entertained 'em." The company got a nine-month run out of Agatha Christie's "The Mousetrap." The conservatory left the ship a year ago -- before it shut down as a restaurant and sank in a San Pedro shipyard, as Campbell likes to point out. For months, she looked for new acting space -- "I checked out any place that had a 'for lease' sign" -- finally settling on the big, high-ceilinged former Easy Reader office in Hermosa Beach. Campbell calls her New Year's Eve bash a "sober alternative" to the customary celebrations, adding, "It's an opportunity to get together and have a housewarming for our new place."

Title: DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BANE SEEKING REELECTION TO ASSEMBLY DESPITE CONTROVERSY
Author: null
Abstract: null
Text: State Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) said Thursday he plans to seek reelection in 1990 to his ninth consecutive term, confident he can blunt the political impact of a controversy over his administration of a medical foundation. The 76-year-old Bane, who chairs the powerful Assembly Rules Committee, rated his reelection prospects as "very good." In his 1988 reelection race, he beat Republican Bruce Dahl with nearly 73% of the vote. But Bane acknowledged he "wasn't helped" politically by a months-long controversy earlier this year over his operation of a national lupus foundation and his wife's role as chairwoman of the state lupus appropriations board. Last June, a coalition of lupus support groups asked the state attorney general's office to investigate the state board's allocation of $800,000 to a physician friend of the Banes, claiming the doctor improperly carried out state lupus research contracts. The groups also asked that the assets of the National Lupus Erythematous Foundation be frozen, saying the foundation was not providing funding for lupus research or patient services. However, state investigators in November concluded that money was not misspent by the state lupus board. They also said funds had not been improperly spent by the foundation, although they recommended it be disbanded due to inactivity. To date, no other Democrat or Republican has announced plans to challenge Bane next year. Bane said he plans to mail copies of newspaper articles about the attorney general's findings to all constituents who complained to him by phone or mail after the controversy surfaced.

Text: A 9-year-old boy was killed when a car driving the wrong way on an Arleta street crashed head-on into a parked truck, pushing the truck over the youth, Los Angeles police reported. Ralph Marsh, son of Ralph and Joyce Marsh of Arleta, was sitting on his bicycle behind the truck, watching workers pour a concrete driveway at the time of the 9:10 a.m. accident, Officer Paul Wunderle said. The 16-year-old driver of the car suffered a minor shoulder injury and was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter, Wunderle said. He was later released to his parents pending an investigation. Wunderle said the 16-year-old appeared to have been speeding and veered into opposing traffic lanes when he took his eyes off the road to push a toy under his seat. The crash occurred on Tonopah Street near Remick Avenue, Wunderle said.

Title: DRUG CHARGE FILED AGAINST '88 POLICE SHOOTING VICTIM
Author: JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: A felony drug charge has been filed against Patrick J. Coyle, the Torrance man whose shooting last year led to the firing of three Torrance police officers. Coyle, 32, was charged Wednesday in South Bay Municipal Court with possession of methamphetamine. His arraignment is scheduled for Jan. 25. Sheriff's deputies said they arrested Coyle on the drug charge while he was with one of two brothers whom authorities were seeking for violating their paroles. Robert Allen Thorpe had been paroled from prison after an attempted-murder conviction, while Ronald Paul Thorpe had been released from state prison after serving time for assault, said Sheriff's Detective Terry Moreland. The brothers had failed to visit their parole officer, who asked the county's Multijurisdictional Criminal Apprehension Detail, based in Carson, to arrest them. Police said they saw Robert Thorpe leaving his mother's home in Lomita on Nov. 29, along with another man who they believed was Ronald Thorpe. They stopped the men a short time later and arrested Robert Thorpe for violating his parole, but learned that the other man was actually Patrick Coyle, Detective Moreland said. Coyle was arrested after officers saw a vial of crystals, which proved to be two grams of methamphetamine, near the gearshift of his 1957 Chevrolet, Moreland said. Coyle, who was released on his own recognizance, could not be reached for comment about the charge. The incident that led to the firing of the three police officers occurred May 9, 1988, when Coyle, an unemployed construction worker, was stopped near Western Avenue by Torrance police. Officer Timothy Pappas, who would later say Coyle was acting suspiciously in a neighborhood frequented by drug dealers, fired a single shot that hit Coyle in the chin and partially paralyzed him. The policeman later told superiors that he fired his gun when Coyle reached suddenly toward a shiny object in his waistband. Two backup officers, Mark Holden and Timothy Thornton, supported that account. But Thornton later said the shooting had been unprovoked. All three officers were fired after the Police Department concluded that they had lied about the incident. Earlier this month, Pappas was fined $2,250 and placed on probation for one year after pleading no contest to misdemeanor charges of falsifying a police report and obstructing an investigation. Holden has been ordered to stand trial on conspiracy charges. Thornton was granted immunity to testify against the other two. The city has admitted liability in the incident, although no settlement has been reached in the case.

Title: INVESTMENT OVERSEAS BY U.S. FIRMS RISING
Author: HISANOBU OHSE, REUTERS
Abstract: null
Text: With all the clamor about foreign investors buying up America, a gradual and steady rise in U.S. investment overseas is passing almost unnoticed. But economists say U.S. companies are increasing their foreign investments, particularly in Europe where the growth opportunities look too good to miss. "Europe is a dynamic growth area," said Conference Board consultant James Greene. He said European investments are especially attractive in light of the European Community's plan to establish a single market by 1992. Ford Motor Co.'s acquisition of Britain's Jaguar PLC and General Motors' purchase of a 50% stake in Saab-Scania of Sweden are just "the tip of the iceberg," said Stephen Cooney, an international investment director at the National Assn. of Manufacturers. Economists say the accelerated rise of U.S. investment abroad should calm some concerns about increasing foreign ownership of American assets. Those concerns rose to a fever-pitch recently when the Mitsubishi Estate Co. acquired a controlling stake in New York's landmark Rockefeller Center. So far this year, American companies have worked out plans to establish 220 manufacturing projects overseas, up from 180 projects in 1988, Greene said. He added that he expects the rising trend to continue for four to five years. U.S. direct investment abroad rose by $25.01 billion in the first nine months of 1988 to $351.91 billion, after rising by $18.9 billion in all of 1988, according to Commerce Department estimates. In the same period, foreign direct investment in the United States grew faster, as it has for most of the decade. Foreign investment rose by $22.65 billion to $350.15 billion after surging $58.44 billion last year. Economists attribute the heavy investment flows both in and out of the United States to the globalization of manufacturing and other industries. Commerce Department economists said U.S. companies plan to spend $48.9 billion for plant and equipment at their overseas affiliates, up from $42.6 billion last year. Their outlays are expected to rise further in the new year, to $49.9 billion. "The underlying trend is definitely up," although the data is volatile, reflecting fluctuating exchange rates and accounting factors, said Cooney at the National Assn. of Manufacturers. In the past, the driving force behind U.S. investment abroad was the cheap foreign labor, said William Archey, an international economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. But that is no longer the case. "The cost of labor is no longer a factor for overseas investment," he said. The main reason American companies want to invest overseas today is to manufacture goods for foreign markets at a competitive cost, even if the start-up expenses are high. "American companies will allocate more dollars abroad," as some 200 American manufacturers have enough cash to make the expensive overseas investment, Greene said. The rise in foreign investment, however, could spell trouble for the weak domestic manufacturing sector. Economists worry that there could be a repeat of the damage caused in the 1960s and 1970s when the domestic sector was hurt by the surge of U.S. investment overseas. "That is quite true, especially in the chemical and electronics industries," Greene said. "It is devastating for unions," he said, but added that "workers will not suffer much, as the service industry will absorb workers (who are pushed out of the manufacturing sector)," he added. As U.S. firms prepare to increase their presence in big markets in Europe and Asia, Japan's barriers to foreign investment are coming under renewed criticism. "Japan is a big market, but we cannot invest there," Archey said. He pointed to two kinds of obstacles: unique Japanese business practices, such as the multilayered distribution system that discriminates against outsiders, and the exceptionally high cost of conducting business in Japan. Business practices could change over the years, but the cost of doing business in Japan is expected to stay high because a much stronger dollar would devastate American exporters.

Title: BURGEONING TOKYO CAREENS TOWARD A QUAKE CALAMITY
Author: LEE DYE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER
Abstract: TOKYO (JAPAN) -- DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT; EARTHQUAKES -- JAPAN; SEISMOLOGY; EARTHQUAKE SAFETY; EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS; FORECASTS; GEOLOGY
Text: Far beneath this modern metropolis, the powerful forces of nature are locked in a slow but deadly battle that will some day bring this great city to its knees. Already overcrowded and growing at a staggering rate, Tokyo sits on a deep sedimentary basin that is like a bowl of jello cradled by one of the most treacherous geological formations on the planet. Bluntly put, there are few places on Earth that are geologically less suited as a site for a great city than here on the shores of Tokyo Bay. Three of the giant slabs of the Earth's crust grind together here in what scientists call a "triple junction." Two of the plates sink beneath the islands of Japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the Earth directly below Tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. Most other earthquake-prone regions, including California, only have to worry about two colliding plates. The threat will get worse in the years ahead because more and more land is being reclaimed from Tokyo Bay to serve the needs of millions more who are flocking to a city already strangling on its own prosperity. Scientists are concerned that land reclaimed from the bay will be particularly hazardous because such soils amplify shock waves from earthquakes. Painfully aware of its problems, Japan is moving full speed ahead in earthquake engineering research, and the country is trying to develop the world's best earthquake warning system before the next great quake hits. But some experts believe Tokyo is already past due for a catastrophic quake, and scientists around the world are watching to see if Japan can win a race against time. The impact of a giant quake here could be felt around the world. Tokyo is a key player in global economics, and some officials fear that a catastrophic quake here could have a devastating effect elsewhere. Frank Press, president of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, has speculated that a great quake here would force Japan to reclaim much of its foreign investment, possibly leading to a collapse of the world economy. Tokyo was leveled once, in 1923, when a monstrous earthquake destroyed a city that had ignored the lessons offered in 1906 from a different city by a distant bay. "If we had understood the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the damages from the Great Kanto Earthquake which came just 17 years later could have been avoided," says Hirokazu Iemura of Kyoto University's Earthquake Engineering Laboratory. Iemura, who toured the Bay Area after last October's quake, is afraid history may repeat itself. The recent San Francisco temblor, he said, demonstrated what scientists call "non-linear" consequences of an earthquake. That means that in some cases the earth may tremble far more than the magnitude of the quake would suggest. The Bay Area quake suggested that Tokyo too may be much more vulnerable than experts had thought. For this and other reasons, Tokyo, most experts agree, has much to worry about. A study last year by Japan's National Land Agency concluded that if a great earthquake -- magnitude 8 or greater -- should strike Tokyo in the middle of the night it would kill about 80,000 people. If it came at lunch time, as it did in 1923, or in the evening when stoves would be lit for cooking and heating, fires would sweep through parts of the city and the death toll could reach 150,000. Many experts here think even those grim estimates are far too low. When the great quake strikes, as everyone here knows it must, it will hit a city that is already so crowded that on a typical day it dwarfs the worst traffic jams that Los Angeles has to offer. Despite widespread planning efforts, there will be few places for people to run, and it will be extremely difficult to reach safety even for those who know where to go. The danger will not be just from falling objects. It will be mainly from fire. "In the 1923 earthquake, 100,000 people burned to death," Iemura said. That is more than twice as many as were killed directly by the 7.9 temblor. And now, all these years later, Iemura and many other experts in Japan are afraid that history may repeat itself. "We are very afraid of fire," said Etsuzo Shima, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo and one of Japan's leading earthquake experts. "We have many wooden houses and the roads are very narrow, and if there is a big fire in the region, many of them will be burned." Nario Oyagi, a geologist-engineer with Japan's National Research Center for Disaster Prevention, thinks Tokyo's congested streets pose a special problem. In his worst nightmares, he sees endless streams of cars ablaze on crowded streets, forming ribbons of fire extending out to the suburbs. Hampered by ruptured water lines, unable to move on the jammed streets, firefighters would be helpless, forced to witness a holocaust of unthinkable dimensions. Tokyo's Metropolitan Fire Department has estimated that fully one-third of the city could be destroyed by fire in a great quake. Japanese authorities are well aware of their peril, and have made dramatic progress in earthquake engineering. The modern buildings of Japan are among the best engineered in the world, and even many older structures are well built because earthquakes here are so much a part of life. But no amount of planning can reduce the geological hazard that lies beneath Tokyo. "This is a very complex place," said Yoshimitsu Okada, who is in charge of the most ambitious effort in the world to predict an earthquake. Okada directs a research team that hopes to predict a major quake about 100 miles south of Tokyo in time to evacuate several crowded cities. Okada knows the quake will come some day because the geological formations beneath Japan are constantly active. The Earth's crust is made up of giant tectonic plates that drift around the planet. The plates slide against each other in some regions, like California, causing earthquakes. In other areas, an oceanic plate slides beneath a continental plate through subduction. The latter is the process that created the active volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest. The islands of Japan are on the Eurasia Plate, which is sliding up over two other plates, the giant Pacific Plate (which also grinds against California on its opposite side) and the Philippine Sea Plate. The Philippine and Pacific plates are being pushed under Japan as the powerful forces crunch together, creating volcanoes as they heat the underside of the Eurasia Plate. And unfortunately for Tokyo, directly beneath the mega-city, the two oceanic plates are colliding as they sink into the Earth's mantle. Temblors occur as the plates are ripped apart while being forced under the Eurasia Plate, so they strike much deeper than the shallow earthquakes in California. However, they can be quite large, well above magnitude 8, so they pose a great danger to areas on the surface. Furthermore, the strength of an earthquake here is magnified by the geological conditions that underlie nearly the entire city of Tokyo. Like Los Angeles, Tokyo and many other cities in Japan are built on sedimentary deposits that have washed down from the mountains over millions of years. Those deposits have formed a huge sedimentary basin beneath what is now the city of Tokyo. In some cases, that basin is up to two miles thick. When an earthquake occurs, the waves of energy flowing from the epicenter are magnified by shifting sedimentary deposits, making the ground shaking more intense. Tokyo has an additional problem because the bedrock on which the sedimentary basin sits is shaped somewhat like a bowl. Shock waves striking the bedrock are reflected back up toward the surface, extending the life of the earthquake. "The duration of the shaking is very long," said Oyagi, of the National Research Center for Disaster Prevention. Officials here know those conditions could add up to disaster for Tokyo, a belief that was reinforced by Kyoto University's Iemura when he returned from his tour of the San Francisco Bay Area after the Oct. 17 quake. He has concluded that Japan still has much to learn from San Francisco as well as Mexico City, which was ravaged by a 7.9 earthquake in 1985 that killed about 9,500 people and caused $3 billion in damages. Most experts here had thought that Mexico City was an "exceptional case," Iemura said. The sprawling city is built on an ancient lake bed, and scientists believe it was particularly vulnerable to ground failure from liquefaction. That occurs when a shallow water table causes the loose sediments to assume the characteristics of a liquid during a large earthquake. "This (liquefaction) had been thought of as very exceptional," Iemura said. But the Bay Area quake demonstrated that liquefaction can occur "along the coast," as in San Francisco's Marina District, he added. "Mexico had been thought so exceptional there was no need to think about it," Iemura said. "But what about San Francisco? Is that also a special case?" Although he thinks the question needs more study, Iemura is troubled by the fact that much of Tokyo is built on areas similar to San Francisco's Marina District. And like San Francisco, Tokyo is extremely short of land on which to build the high rises needed to house the millions who continue to flock to this crowded city. The answer to the land shortage, Japanese authorities have concluded, is to reclaim more land from Tokyo Bay -- a prospect that deeply troubles many experts. Many of the new structures going up in Tokyo these days are built on filled land, and some people here hope someday to fill in the entire bay, making room for even more people and more buildings. If San Francisco was not an "exceptional case," that trend could prove disastrous, many experts believe. Tokyo University's Shima believes there is only one answer, and that is to reverse the flow of people into Tokyo. One group is proposing that the capital be moved out of Tokyo, hoping that the forced move of government workers will result in a lower death toll when the quake hits. Local authorities are resisting that suggestion, but Shima insists that some people are now taking it seriously. "We are very afraid because we are now going to build a lot of high-rise buildings in the bay area," he said. "That will increase the population, and that's not so good." The earthquake hazards facing Tokyo are not just a local problem because Japan has become a major participant -- some say the dominant player -- in international economics. A devastating quake here would be felt in board rooms around the world. Experts believe insurance companies would be able to cover only a small percentage of the loss. The Japanese government has put a ceiling of around $60,000 on each private residence in a city where a humble abode costs 10 times that amount. And Tokyo is a major nerve center in the fragile network that constitutes the global economy. Next: Preparing for The Big One DANGEROUS INTERSECTION Japan ranks among the most geologically active regions in the world. Earthquakes occur chiefly in areas where giant slabs of the Earth's crust, called tectonic plates, either grind past each other or crunch together in a process called "subduction" that forces one plate under another. Japan, however, has to concern itself with four plates. Most of the islands are on the giant Eurasia Plate, although the North American Plate reaches up over the Arctic and down to the northern tip of the archipelago. The Pacific and the Philippine Sea plates are being forced under the Eurasia Plate, and the two subducting plates collide directly beneath Tokyo. That dynamic process is why the region is capable of generating catastrophic earthquakes, like the temblor that destroyed Tokyo in 1923, as well as about 1,000 smaller quakes every month.

Title: CEAUSESCU'S RULE INVADED MINDS, DREAMS, INTIMACY
Author: DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: CEAUSESCU, NICOLAE; ROMANIA -- GOVERNMENT; EMOTIONS; BEHAVIOR; PSYCHOLOGY; LIFESTYLES; QUALITY OF LIFE; DREAMS; STANDARD OF LIVING
Text: The young woman, her dark hair tied back in a long braid, sat in the chair by the fire, her face pulled tight by the unsuccessful effort to hold back tears. "I am sorry," Dmitra said, "I do not mean to offend, but the rest of the world -- journalists, everyone -- watches this like some kind of movie, something not real. "For us," she said, "it is real. We have a different kind of psyche now. It is something manufactured by Ceausescu." In his 24-year reign over Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu had his political prisoners, with house arrest for those well known in the West, hellish prisons and sudden disappearances for others. But for the vast majority of Romania's 23 million citizens, people who only now are beginning to speak freely about their lives, the horror of Ceausescu's totalitarian rule was something less dramatic but more insidious. Totalitarian rule bruised minds and warped relationships. Romania under Ceausescu was a land of privation, fear and constant intervention in the intimate decisions of daily life. It was a land that killed dreams. For Petre -- like all others in this article, this is not his real name -- the dream was to pursue his chosen field of study, mathematics. A talented university student, Petre was among the top members of his class. But upon graduation, he and his classmates were told they would not be allowed to continue their studies or teach at the university level. They would have to leave Bucharest and take jobs teaching grade-school arithmetic in the countryside. "I tried to do research as a hobby," Petre said. He would travel hundreds of miles on weekends to the few libraries sporadically allowed to receive Western scientific literature. There, he would copy papers by hand to get around Ceausescu's ban on the private use of copying machines. "These are my best years to do research and work. It's a loss," he said. "I wanted to get a scholarship to attend a school abroad and get my Ph.D.," he said. "But I was very good, and they were afraid I would not come back, so I could not." In the 25 years of his life, Petre has been allowed to leave his country only once -- to travel several years ago to a mathematics conference in East Germany, where, he said, "People looked freer to act. They were able to speak. They were able to have contacts. They were able to work." East Germany, he concluded, "was a real paradise." Dmitra and her husband, Ioan, had a more domestic dream. "I wanted a child -- not one child, I wanted six children," Dmitra said with a short and bitter laugh. "Do you remember?" she asked her husband. "We got married in 1977; I was 21." The two are quick to say they led comparatively privileged lives. Sophisticated and intelligent, both are well-educated professionals. Ioan's job has allowed him occasional travel in the West and access to goods -- coffee, perfume, clothing, American cigarettes -- that could be resold, providing money that cushioned the grim life in Ceausescu's "model state." "I consoled myself with these," said Dmitra, pointing to the color television and video recorder in the small sitting room of their house. But consumer goods could not block out the reality of daily life. In the mid-1970s, Ceausescu, who assumed power in 1965, had only recently begun to fully impose his grotesque plans on the nation. Seeing what was happening, the young couple put aside thoughts of a family. "What could we offer this child?" Dmitra explained. "What life?" A treasured uncle had a son who fled to the West. Ioan and Dmitra felt they had no choice but to cut off all communications. The uncle was now a watched man, and even a simple telephone conversation might cost Ioan his passport or his job. Dmitra talked about food: In Eastern Europe's richest agricultural region, "women -- young, old -- were struggling at the shop when they brought pig's feet, and without meat, only bones and gristle." Chickens were "like crows. No, a crow was too big -- eight chickens, one kilo" (2.2 pounds). Last month, Ioan's father "had to stay four days in line, from 5 in the morning until dark, to buy 2 kilos of meat." Dmitra, who as a child had dreamed of travel "to see other places, other people," had to abandon the idea. Because Ioan already had a passport, "I couldn't even dream" of taking her outside the country, he said. "It would have meant becoming an informer. That was what the price was. "I wasn't even able to cross the Friendship Bridge to Bulgaria," Dmitra said. Broadcasts of Radio Free Europe and videotapes of Western movies, eagerly passed from hand to hand, brought evidence of the deprivations Romanians faced. The program guide to Bulgarian television became one of Bucharest's most hotly sought underground publications as Romanians sought any kind of diversion from their own television's constant repetition of Ceausescu's speeches, Ceausescu's appearances, Ceausescu's decrees. Ceausescu seemed as invincible as he was omnipresent. Even in recent weeks, watching events elsewhere in the region on Bulgarian television, "I was sure it would never happen here," said Dmitra. "It couldn't. It was impossible. Ceausescu was like a god -- not a good god, an evil god. No one could conquer him." Dmitra and Ioan's decision not to have children bordered on subversion. The Leader, as Ceausescu liked to be called, had set as a national priority the increase of Romania's population to 30 million -- from about 23 million now -- by the end of the century. Until Tuesday, when the new government began repealing Ceausescu's decrees, all Romanian women were required to have periodic state-administered gynecological examinations. Doctors were required to report all pregnancies to the police. All forms of contraception were banned. The single and the childless were subject to a tax of up to 12% of their salaries. Discovering she was pregnant, Dmitra obtained an illegal abortion. Two months later, she learned the doctor had been arrested and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. Twice more over the next six years, Dmitra became pregnant. She induced abortions herself. The second time, in 1983, massive infection set in. Fearing detection but suffering a 104-degree fever, Dmitra went to the hospital, hoping to find a doctor she could trust not to report her. "I was seeing death with my eyes," she said. In the overcrowded ward, three women died that week. "No one was watching me. No one from my family knew where I had been taken." In the end, "I was lucky," she said. "I survived." From then on, said Ioan, except on the rare times when he could smuggle contraceptives into the country, "we just had to restrain ourselves." Four years ago, fearing they were growing old, the couple put aside their fears and had a child. Today, Dmitra and Ioan hope the shy, blond-haired girl will grow up innocent of the horrors her parents endured. Petre once more dares to hope that he will be able to resume his mathematical studies, perhaps even go abroad and obtain his doctorate. Dmitra has resumed her hopes of seeing distant lands. But, she said, "I cannot leave behind the feeling of uncertainty and fear and suspicion. I think a lot of people in this country will have those feelings for a long, long time. It's a second nature."

Title: DUBCEK WINS KEY CZECH POST AFTER 2 DECADES
Author: Associated Press
Abstract: DUBCEK, ALEXANDER; CZECHOSLOVAKIA -- ELECTIONS; CZECHOSLOVAKIA -- GOVERNMENT; CZECHOSLOVAKIA -- GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS; GOVERNMENT REFORM; CZECHOSLOVAKIA -- POLITICS; CZECHOSLOVAKIA -- REVOLTS; COMMUNIST PARTY (CZECHOSLOVAKIA); CZECHOSLOVAKIA -- CONSTITUTIONS; CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
Text: Alexander Dubcek, the champion of the Prague Spring reforms, triumphantly returned to power Thursday as the Speaker of Parliament after two decades in forced obscurity. "This is a moral satisfaction to the hundreds of thousands of people who have upheld the ideals" of political pluralism and individual freedom, Dubcek told lawmakers after he was unanimously elected by the 269 deputies present. The televised vote by the Communist-dominated 350-member Federal Assembly for a man ousted and banished by authorities would have been unimaginable just two months ago. Dubcek's political renaissance is just the latest in a series of historic political victories for Czechoslovakia's pro-democracy movement. Since mid-November, it has ousted the hard-line Communist leadership and installed a reform government dominated by non-Communists. Czechoslovakia's changes have come amid democratic reforms in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania this year. Today, the Parliament is to meet at Prague's Hradcany Castle to elect playwright and opposition leader Vaclav Havel as president. Havel is to be inaugurated immediately after the vote. Deputies voted Thursday to amend the presidential oath to be taken by Havel to eliminate the pledge of allegiance to socialism. In his acceptance speech before Parliament, Dubcek praised the peaceful revolution as a continuation of the reforms that began in 1968 and were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion. "The deep changes in society . . . have resulted in my return to responsible work in the highest legislative body in the land," Dubcek said. "The autumn of 1989 developed the ideals of the Prague Spring of 1968 and inspires our nation today toward new creative actions." After the Soviet-led invasion, Dubcek was ousted as Communist Party chief, expelled from the party and sent to work as a forestry manager in Bratislava where he was kept under police surveillance. Although renowned abroad, he was excluded from the state-controlled media in Czechoslovakia. He recaptured the spotlight Nov. 24, speaking to 250,000 pro-democracy demonstrators on Prague's Wenceslas Square. Next to Havel, Dubcek is the second most powerful symbol of reform in Czechoslovakia and is the favorite son in his native Slovakia. Dubcek's role in the new government was decided during intense negotiations between the opposition, representatives of the Communist Party and members of smaller parties and political groups. The talks also produced a list of new deputies to replace 23 hard-line Communists who resigned. The government is to serve until elections are held next year, possibly in July. Parliament voted Thursday to amend the constitution to allow the appointment of the new deputies, including Dubcek. Only one of the 23 new deputies is a Communist Party member. The others are members of smaller parties or are independent, although Communist Party members will continue to hold the majority until free elections. Communist Party leaders Ladislav Adamec and Vasil Mohorita sent a message of congratulations to Dubcek and said the ideals of 1968 are a "source of political inspiration for the party's new policies of democratic socialism." The Prague daily Vecerni Praha reported Thursday the first arrest of a major Communist Party figure since the revolution. Miroslav Stepan, ousted Prague Communist Party boss, was being held in custody after his arrest Dec. 23, the newspaper reported. "Stepan was indicted for preparing the criminal act of abuse of power of a public official," the newspaper reported.

Title: SEX-SHOW SENTENCES DISALLOWED; COURT: STATE JUSTICES SAY A JURY TRIAL IS APPROPRIATE TO CONTEST CHARGES OF PERMITTING LEWD ACTS AND PROSTITUTION IN VIOLATION OF A COURT ORDER.
Author: PHILIP HAGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT -- RULINGS; ADULT ENTERTAINMENT; CENSORSHIP; MORALITY; SENTENCING; DISMISSALS; JURY SYSTEM; CIVIL RIGHTS; CALIFORNIA -- CONSTITUTIONS; LEWD CONDUCT; PROSTITUTION; HYPNOSIS; WITNESSES; MURDERS -- CALIFORNIA; THEATERS
Text: The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that sex-show operators and others are entitled to a jury trial to contest charges of permitting lewd acts and prostitution in violation of a court order. The justices struck down the six-month jail terms and $62,000 in fines facing James and Artie Mitchell of San Francisco in a contempt proceeding brought without a jury under the state Red Light Abatement Law. The court, in a lead opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson, noted that even though the sentences were imposed for contempt, their severity matched that for violations of many criminal misdemeanors. "The California Constitution guarantees the defendant the right to trial by jury in such a proceeding," Eagleson wrote. The decision marked the second time the case has come before the state high court -- and the justices Thursday reached substantially the same result as in a previous January, 1987, ruling under then-Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird. Shortly after Bird and two other justices defeated in the fall, 1986, election left office, the new and more conservative court voted quickly to reconsider the theater case and five other recently issued rulings by the old court. In five other cases, however, Bird court decisions were rejected or significantly modified. Significant Ruling The decision was hailed by an attorney for the Mitchells as a significant expansion of the right to a jury trial. "Historically, the jury has been a fundamental protection of the citizen against overzealous prosecutors and pliant judges," said Thomas Steel of San Francisco. "In a case like this, where emotions often run high, a jury is especially important. It keeps the average citizen in the process of decision-making." Amitai Schwartz, who represented the Bar Assn. of San Francisco in urging the justices to uphold the jury-trial right, said: "It's good to see the California Constitution is alive and well. . . . There's been no retreat." State Deputy Atty. Gen. Laurence Sullivan expressed disappointment with the ruling but declined to speculate on its potential effect. "We felt we had a reasonable argument against a jury trial here," Sullivan said. "But obviously the court disagreed. We accept that." In Thursday's action, the court set down other restrictive guidelines for contempt proceedings under the venerable abatement act, a law that allows officials to proceed against businesses that offer lewd performances and prostitution. The justices ruled that violators of injunctions in such cases may be charged with only one count of contempt for every day prohibited acts occur -- rather than being charged with one count per act. Permitting a $1,000 fine for each lewd act would be "totally out of proportion," the court observed. And while as an alternative, violators may be held liable for contempt without a jury trial under a separate, more lenient law -- one with a maximum five days in jail and $1,000 fine -- the accused must be notified at the outset under which law prosecutors intend to proceed, the court said. The ruling resulted from a nine-year legal battle between authorities and the Mitchell brothers, proprietors of a well-known film and live adult-theater business that has operated for more than 20 years here. In 1980, San Francisco prosecutors filed a public-nuisance action against the Mitchells and theater manager Vincent Stanich under the abatement law. A court injunction was issued barring the men from allowing acts of "lewdness or prostitution" at the theater. In 1982, police visiting the premises over a four-day period charged that performers permitted patrons to engage in oral copulation and other acts off stage in return for tips. On stage, police said, performers engaged in several lewd acts with other performers. After a hearing without a jury, Superior Court Judge Frank W. Shaw found that the three men had violated the injunction. Under provisions of the abatement law, the two Mitchells were each fined $62,000 -- $1,000 for each of 62 lewd acts. Stanich was fined $6,200 -- $100 for each act. All three were sentenced to the maximum six months in jail but the sentences were stayed pending appeal. In Thursday's decision, the court noted that the state Constitution guaranteed trial by jury for all alleged misdemeanors as well as felonies. By clear implication, the justices said, such protection was intended to extend to other proceedings where jail terms and fines were as severe as that for some misdemeanors. The court rejected the theater operators' contention that there was insufficient evidence of lewd acts or prostitution occurring in violation of the injunction. The justices found, however, that there was not enough proof that Stanich, the manager, had been able to prevent the acts that took place. While the Mitchell brothers could be retried, Stanich may not, the court said. All six court members who participated in the case agreed that the contempt judgments must be invalidated. Justice Joyce L. Kennard, the newest member of the court, did not participate. Justice Stanley Mosk, in a concurring opinion, said he did not believe prosecutors should be allowed to proceed under the more lenient contempt statute in order to prevent defendants from receiving a jury trial. In another decision Thursday, the court reaffirmed its previously imposed ban on testimony induced by hypnosis -- but ruled that in some instances, witnesses may still testify about their recollections before they were hypnotized. The court, ruling in a 1979 San Mateo County murder case, reversed the defendant's conviction because post-hypnotic testimony identifying him as the killer was erroneously allowed. But on retrial, the witness will be permitted to testify about events that she recalled and related before hypnosis, the justices said. A 1985 state law sharply restricts the use of pre-hypnosis testimony to cases where statements have been preserved in writing or tape and subsequent hypnosis was performed by licensed experts. But the law, the court said, applies only to pre-hypnotic evidence taken after the law was passed.

Title: RAIN PASSES THROUGH BUT AREA STILL DRY
Author: CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: RAIN; STORMS -- SAN DIEGO; WEATHER FORECASTING
Text: A storm system passed through Southern California on Thursday, ushering in enough showers to dampen roads and hastily unfurled umbrellas, but not nearly enough to affect the drought that has gripped the state for nearly four years. The first rain of December -- and possibly the last of the year -- hit the Los Angeles area and Orange County early Thursday as the weak frontal system worked its way south toward San Diego and then east into Arizona, said Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. "We're not looking at anything significant," said Dittmann. "It's not going to be a drought-breaker by any means." Since July, only 1.07 inches of rain have been recorded at the Los Angeles Civic Center. That is more than three inches below normal. "It's looking pretty bad," Dittmann said. "We can still have a wet January, February and March and end up above normal," the forecaster said. "But again, it needs to kick in soon." The low-pressure system, moving along the coastline from Northern California, was expected to bring little relief, dropping less than .10 of an inch of rain in the Los Angeles area, and perhaps a quarter of an inch in the mountains before beginning to clear the Southland by this morning, Dittmann said. "It doesn't have the moisture to be a heavy rain producer for Southern California," Dittmann said. "It's moving so quickly (that) any showers will be moving quickly also and it won't be able to rain on any area for long." Nevertheless, moderate to heavy rains were reported in the San Diego area during the evening. The National Weather service said the storm dumped 1.01 inches at Lindbergh Field between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. The downpour tied the all-time record for the date set in 1931. By late Thursday, only traces had been reported from Newport Beach north to Westwood, the weather service said. An upper-level low-pressure system will remain in the storm's wake, settling on the southwest coast and possibly bringing showers to some local areas over the next two days. But "as it looks now," said Dittmann, "we'll have fair weather over the weekend and into the new year." Thursday's Civic Center high was 65 degrees. A similar reading was expected today, with a high near 70 on Saturday, forecasters say.

Title: ON-SITE DRUG SALES PERIL TO LIQUOR LICENSE; NARCOTICS: NEW LAW EFFECTIVE NEXT WEEK WILL GREATLY SHORTEN PERIOD IN WHICH OFFICIALS MAY PUT ESTABLISHMENTS OUT OF COMMISSION.
Author: JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: LIQUOR LICENSES; GOVERNMENT REGULATION; CALIFORNIA -- LAWS; DRUG SALES; BARS; ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES; DRUG TRAFFICKING -- CALIFORNIA
Text: Owners of bars and other liquor outlets who knowingly allow drug dealers to operate on their premises could have their liquor licenses confiscated in as little as 10 days under a law that takes effect next week, a state legislator who authored the measure said Thursday. Standing in front of a closed-up Boyle Heights lounge where there were frequent arrests for drug use, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said the new law dramatically shortens the period it takes for state and local officials to seize a license. Katz explained that under the current law, owners are allowed to fight the confiscation process in court, which can take up to three years. Throughout that time, he said, drug sales can continue. "There will be no more courtroom tricks" to delay the seizing of liquor licenses, said Katz, who was joined by community leaders who had helped push the bill through the Legislature. "Too many neighborhoods are suffering." The assemblyman said there has been a "significant increase" in the amount of drugs being dealt out of bars, adding that in the first four months of 1989 there was a 240% increase in the number of liquor licenses the state has moved to revoke because of drug sales. Katz said the bar behind him was an example of how difficult it is for the state to revoke a license under the current law. Sought to Seize License He said the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control attempted for two years to confiscate the license of Estrellas De Noche, located in the 2400 block of East 1st Street, but the owners fought the revocation. During the last year, he said, as many as 20 narcotics arrests were made at the bar, including the bartender. Before the dispute with the ABC could be settled, Katz said, the bar owners voluntarily gave up their liquor license. The owners could not be reached for comment. The bar was closed only two weeks ago, according to Marcos Ramirez, 26, a neighborhood resident who said that drug dealers used to hang out on the sidewalk in front of the bar. "I think this is great," Ramirez said of the recent closure. "All they did was scare people around the neighborhood." Jay Stroh, the director of the ABC, complained that it has been "very difficult" to act against a license-holder because of built-in delays in the legal system. "This will give us further tentacles to get out and remove these problems," he said. The law allows local district attorneys or the state attorney general to go to Superior Court to seize a license of a bar owner, or a convenience store where beer and wine is sold. A hearing is then required to be held within 10 days. At the close of the hearing, the court can seize the license. Katz said leaders from various community organizations helped fight the so-called "liquor lobby" to get the bill passed. But John Pierce, a staff attorney for the ABC, said the law would likely be limited in its application because authorities must prove that the bar owner knew about and consented to the drug sales. "This is a fairly limited situation," he said. He said that in most cases bar owners say they had no idea illegal activity was occurring on their premises, or outside in the parking lot. "We don't really know how the statute will work out," Pierce said. He estimated that the new law might be used in 10% to 20% of the cases brought by the ABC. But even that limited use is important to neighborhoods battling drug dealers who duck into friendly business establishments when police drive by, according to Katz and several community leaders.

Title: REBIRTH OF A MURDER CASE; JUSTICE: AS AN 8-YEAR-OLD, A GIRL WONDERED WHY POLICE DIDN'T ASK HER ABOUT HER FRIEND'S MURDER. AS A 29-YEAR-OLD, SHE GETS A CHANCE TO TALK -- AND ACCUSES HER FATHER.
Author: SUZETTE PARMLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: MURDERS -- CALIFORNIA; CHILD MOLESTATION; FATHERS; SEX CRIMES; FRANKLIN LIPSKER, EILEEN; FRANKLIN, GEORGE THOMAS SR; NASON, SUSAN; WITNESSES; EMOTIONS; FRIENDSHIP
Text: After Eileen Franklin-Lipsker witnessed the murder of her best friend, she wondered why no one, including police investigators, thought to question her because she was only 8 years old. Now, at 29, she will finally testify, and what she will say, she promises, is that the man she saw commit the crime was her own father. Franklin-Lipsker, who came forward with her accusation for the first time last month, is the key witness against George Thomas Franklin Sr., 50, a former San Mateo firefighter. Based largely on his daughter's account of the crime, Franklin stands accused of the first-degree murder of 8-year-old Susan Nason during a sexual assault. Susan disappeared from her home in Foster City, south of San Francisco, on Sept. 22, 1969. Her decomposed body was found months later under a mattress near a reservoir in San Mateo. "Susan was my best friend," Franklin-Lipsker said during a telephone interview Thursday from her Canoga Park home. "We were kids who played together outside a lot and played tetherball on the school yards. "It's still unbelievable to me that I was never questioned about my best friend's murder after it happened," she said. In the intervening years, Franklin-Lipsker said, she blocked out the memory of the murder. She finally went to police after she started having vivid flashbacks of the murder, as she says she recalls it, down to its minute details, including her father bludgeoning Susan to death with a rock in the family van. Franklin pleaded not guilty to the murder charge after he was arrested in November at his home in Carmichael, a suburb of Sacramento. He is being held at a San Mateo County jail in lieu of $2-million bail. A judge ordered the high bail because of allegations of Franklin's sexual interest in children. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for Jan. 22, and a preliminary hearing will begin March 5. On Wednesday, San Mateo County Municipal Judge James L. Browning Jr. threw out a gag order that had barred Franklin-Lipsker and other potential witnesses from talking about the case. "I'm putting all my faith in the justice system to get this resolved," Franklin-Lipsker said. Although she won't discuss the details of the murder of her girlhood friend -- except to say that she saw her father do it in the family van -- she does discuss the implications of the incident for herself. "I don't think I'll ever lead a normal life again," she said. "I'm not just a witness to a crime, I'm a witness to a crime that my father committed -- the same man who is the father of all my brothers and sisters and is the grandfather of my children." Franklin-Lipsker still recalls the special friendship she and Susan shared as carefree youngsters as they played together in bayside Foster City south of San Francisco. "We were kindred spirits," she said. "We had somewhat the same features and were bonded by the torment from the other kids because of our reddish hair and freckles." Franklin-Lipsker said Susan's death had a profound impact on her ability to get close to people. "I guess what I really lost was the ability to feel safe making friends," she said. "I developed this fear of loss and became a real loner after that." Franklin-Lipsker married Barry Lipsker in 1984. The couple runs a computer consulting firm from their home and have two children, Jessica, 6, and Aaron, 3. The family is planning to move to Switzerland to establish their business there soon after the trial. In the meantime, Franklin-Lipsker said she has avoided reading stories about the case or watching news accounts on television. She has even refused to discuss the crime in detail with any of her relatives, she said. By not talking about it, she said, she hopes to keep the memory accurate. "I know what I remember and I don't want anything to influence my memory," she said. The Lipskers also have shielded their children from the case. Barry Lipsker has made news clippings and placed them in an album for the children to look through "when they're old enough to understand," he said, joining his wife briefly in the telephone interviews. "I feel very protective of my children," Franklin-Lipsker said. "They were the impetus for me to come forward because I love them so much." She said most of the reaction from her friends and family has been supportive. "No one has disbelieved me," she said. "I've just developed this general leeriness about people's reaction to it, particularly among people I know and work with. "At the Christmas party, everyone talked about it. It made me quite upset that there might be some judgment about me." Franklin-Lipsker hopes her coming forward encourages others who have witnessed crimes to do the same. "I would hope people who live in fear and have a way to resolve it will come forward like myself," she said. "They just have to believe that it's the right thing to do no matter who it involves."

Title: AIRLINE TELLS OF BOMB THREAT TO PARIS FLIGHT, LETS PASSENGERS CANCEL
Author: Associated Press
Abstract: BOMBS; THREATS; AIRPLANE SAFETY; TRANSPORTATION SAFETY; NORTHWEST AIRLINES; AIRLINE PASSENGERS
Text: Northwest Airlines took the unusual step Thursday of offering to cancel reservations on one of its international flights because of a bomb warning. Reservations clerks were informing callers of a "security threat" made against Saturday's Flight 51 from Paris to Detroit. The Federal Aviation Administration said it knew about the telephoned threat and was making sure that airport security is increased in Paris. The airline said that the flight would go as scheduled, but it was giving customers the option of making other travel arrangements. "This is an unusual threat in the fact that it's very specific, directed at a specific flight on a particular day, and that is what adds to the precautions that we're taking surrounding it," Northwest spokesman Douglas Miller said in St. Paul, Minn. He said that someone telephoned the airline and warned that a bomb would be aboard the flight and that Northwest had informed the FAA, FBI, CIA and foreign agencies. He would not say when or where the threat was received and would give no other details. Security precautions were being stepped up on all Northwest flights out of Paris, Miller said. "We intend to fly the plane," he said. "We feel that we have all the precautions and security measures in place to operate the plane safely." Miller said that the airline had not decided whether to notify passengers individually before show-up time for the flight. A printed advisory about the bomb threat will be handed to those who go to the airport for departure on Saturday, he said. "They can change their itineraries without penalty," he said. Airlines usually prohibit reservation changes or charge extra for them. FAA spokesman John Leyden said that officials were "working with Northwest and with the French authorities to ensure there is extra security on the flight." Leyden said the bomb threat came in an anonymous telephone call and was one of about 300 that U.S. carriers receive each year. Survivors of those killed when Pan Am Flight 103 blew up over Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988, have been critical of airlines and the FAA for not warning passengers of threats made against flights on that route.

Title: FEARFUL BEIJING NOW UNLIKELY TO LIFT MARTIAL LAW
Author: Reuters
Abstract: CHINA -- MARTIAL LAW; CHINA -- REVOLTS; CHINA -- GOVERNMENT; UNITED STATES -- FOREIGN RELATIONS -- CHINA; ROMANIA -- REVOLTS; CHINA -- FOREIGN RELATIONS -- ROMANIA; CHINA -- POLITICS; UNITED STATES -- TRADE -- CHINA
Text: The bloody uprising in Romania culminating in the execution of longtime leader Nicolae Ceausescu has alarmed China's hard-line leaders and dimmed hopes for an early relaxation of martial law in Beijing. American and other Western officials have repeatedly advised China that the removal of martial law would be a key step in restoring ties with the West. It would also help President Bush, who has been under fire from Congress for being too soft on China. But diplomats said Thursday that Beijing could not afford to risk removing martial law, imposed more than six months ago, about two weeks before the army smashed its way into the capital to crush mass student-led protest demonstrations. "The leadership is twitching with fear," said a Western diplomat. "China's leaders are extremely tense because of Romania. It is much more difficult for them to move (on martial law) now." Eastern European diplomats agreed. "I don't see how they can lift martial law now," said an East European envoy. "They may have to keep it in place until the Asian Games." Beijing hosts the games next September. Bush has sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to China on two missions to try to repair damage to ties from Beijing's crackdown on students in June. He has agreed to allow China to launch three U.S.-built satellites and removed a ban on trade credits by the U.S. Export-Import Bank. "China is aware that Congress is profoundly unhappy with Bush over the Scowcroft missions and that something is expected in return," a Western diplomat said. China's response has been minimal. It has agreed to allow the Voice of America broadcasting service to replace an expelled correspondent in Beijing, and to talk about an academic program. Beijing's public reaction to the upheaval in Romania has been cautious. It played down the unrest initially, giving its citizens only brief and vague reports, but later reported the execution of Ceausescu, the hard-line Communist president who resisted reforms sweeping Eastern Europe and was one of Beijing's staunchest allies. Beijing has since congratulated the new leaders and expressed its wishes for continued friendship. Out of the public eye, it has taken a tough position, tightening security at campuses, giving Communist Party members the "correct" version of events and accusing Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of ultimately being to blame. China insists that it is different from Romania, distant from Eastern Europe and with a brand of communism that sprang from its own revolution rather than being imposed by a foreign power. But there are many similarities. Like Romania, China used massive force to crush unrest, resulting in heavy casualties. Beijing's policies are highly unpopular and there is widespread personal dislike for certain members of the leadership.

Title: $1.2 BILLION NEEDED FOR REBUILDING, PANAMANIANS SAY; ECONOMIC AID: OFFICIALS LIKEN THE TASK TO THE RECONSTRUCTION OF JAPAN AFTER WORLD WAR II. THEY LOOK TO THE U.S. FOR MOST OF THE MONEY.
Author: KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: PANAMA -- ECONOMY; PANAMA -- GOVERNMENT; FORD, GUILLERMO (BILLY); UNITED STATES -- FOREIGN AID -- PANAMA; PANAMA -- FINANCES; BUREAUCRACY; PANAMA -- GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS; NORIEGA, MANUEL A; UNITED STATES -- FOREIGN RELATIONS -- PANAMA; PANAMA -- DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT; ENDARA, GUILLERMO; ARIAS CALDERON, RICARDO
Text: Panama will need at least $1.2 billion to rebuild its economy from the wreckage left by the ravages of Manuel A. Noriega's corrupt rule and the devastation that accompanied the American invasion and occupation of the country, Panamanian officials and economists say. Likening the task to the radical reconstruction of Japan after World War II, Second Vice President Guillermo (Billy) Ford said in an interview that "we will easily need $1.2 billion, not just for the physical" projects, "but to create an attractive and positive atmosphere for investment." While listing international financial organizations and other governments as sources for help, Ford, who still carries a .45-caliber automatic pistol in his waistband, made it clear that he expects most of the aid to come from the United States. "The president (Guillermo Endara) has appointed special envoys to the United States . . . whose mission is to obtain liberation" of funds held up by Washington as part of its economic sanctions against the Noriega regime and to negotiate other financial assistance, he said. The vice president -- who, among government leaders, met the American invasion most warmly and who has appeared least worried about the psychological, social and cultural impact of a foreign occupation -- nevertheless said that the United States must pay to help heal the scars left by the invasion. "I don't know how much it should be," he said as he rocked back and forth behind the desk he uses in his temporary office in the Foreign Ministry. "But I am looking for funds from the United States to indemnify us for property destroyed" in the invasion. And that, he said emphatically, "should be unqualified -- not a loan." The initial object of the Panamanians working in Washington for aid is to obtain the release of hundreds of millions of dollars in Panama Canal revenue and taxes owed by American companies operating in Panama that had been impounded by the United States in the effort to penalize Noriega. However, this is the focus of the first point of disagreement between the two countries. Panamanian officials privately say they should receive at least $700 million from the escrow accounts where the money has been held for the past three years. The United States, on the other hand, says the figure is $400 million. The size and cost of the reconstruction effort is so immense, most experts say, that it is unlikely the country will ever recover its one-time level of prosperity. If it does, they say, it will be as a total dependent of the United States, addicted as much to American financing as Noriega was to drug-trafficking money. 'We Are Bankrupt' "The Americans already are planning a lower grant package than expected," said political economist Marcos A. Gandasequi. "We are bankrupt and will be forced to accept money as loans. That will push Panama into the same Third World debt cycle that has ruined other nations in the region." But even before considering such long-term economic implications of the revolution sparked by the Dec. 20 American invasion and the removal of Noriega from power, the pressures caused by the economic emergency are providing the first signs of conflict between the Panamanian administration and its American sponsors. Political experts also say that the three men who form the ruling coalition -- Endara, Ford and First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon -- are already at odds over development strategy. Adding to both the economic and political strains created by the Noriega government and the destruction of war are conflicting U.S. and Panamanian views as to the purpose of the invasion and how long American troops will remain here. Then there is the problem of inexperience in the Endara government and the nightmarish need to continue using the leftover Noriega bureaucracy, a labyrinth of corruption and inefficiency. "I wish the American soldiers had blown up every government office and all the bureaucrats inside," said one Panamanian official who asked not to be named because he still has to work with the old civil service. "At least then our mistakes would be our own." "I can't get anything done," Ford said. "I say, 'Let's do this,' and two hours later someone returns and asks, 'Do you really want to do that?' "When I say yes, I mean yes, and when I say no, I mean no," Ford said, waving his hands, "but no one believes me." Mistakes, bureaucratic blockages, even sabotage -- these all pale before the grotesque problems of both developing an economic reconstruction program and paying for it. "The situation without the war would have been a tough problem to solve under any circumstance," said a European diplomat with close contacts to the new government. "Noriega's theft set this place back 30 years. But the invasion set it back even more. It is fair to say there is no economy right now." It was not always that way. When Noriega assumed power in 1981, Panama had Central America's highest standard of living. Bank deposits totaled $42 billion, a free trade zone was attracting large-scale investments, particularly from Asia, the Panama Canal revenues financed a generous social security system and tourism brought in hundreds of millions of dollars. The country's economy always had a high quotient of corruption, but not so much that it disturbed either the consciences of the entrepreneurial middle class or the profitability of their businesses. But as Noriega consolidated his power, corruption became the major engine of government economic policy, and drug trafficking and related money-laundering eventually came to play such a major role in the economy that foreign investment began to slacken. When the United States initiated economic sanctions as part of its effort to drive Noriega from office, the total value of the country's wealth ultimately dropped by about 40%; unemployment climbed to at least 30%, and the government's credit dropped to zero, with its checks regularly bouncing. An example of the size of the corruption is seen in the administration of the free trade zone, According to U.S. sources, the head of the government commission that ran the zone, one-time presidential candidate and Noriega crony Carlos Duque, siphoned off $275 million a year, or about 8% of the zone's total revenues, for distribution among Noriega's favorite army officers. Duque was described as taking $25 million as his share. There are no estimates of the damage caused by the fighting during the invasion, although huge slum neighborhoods were destroyed by the battles and the fires that followed. "There is no real way of telling," one local banker said, "but if they want to build modern neighborhoods, the costs could be hundreds of millions of dollars." Bankers also say the cost of repairing and restocking businesses and shops vandalized and looted during the three days after the invasion will be hundreds of millions of dollars, very little of which will be covered by insurance. If there is anything that reflects Panamanians' relatively relaxed approach to disaster, it is the emergence of a large, makeshift market near the U.S. military headquarters where looted products ranging from $80 pairs of running shoes to state-of-the-art Japanese television sets are sold at cut-rate prices as American troops patrol nearby. 'The Panamanian Way' "It's the Panamanian way of redistribution of wealth," said one American diplomat. But that was the only bit of humor in a day that saw the government reopen the nation's banks and issue paychecks to public workers. While Ford promoted this as a sign of progress and stability, in reality he had to obtain $50 million from the United States so the banks here would have enough money to cash checks. The vice president's program, admittedly sketchy after only eight days in office, is aimed at turning the country into an unrestricted free-market economy in order to attract huge foreign investment, international banking operations and tourism and to encourage local businesses to expand and operate efficiently. "The idea is that private enterprise in a free market will create jobs, which means we can cut back on the number of public workers and cut the government payroll and costs," Ford said. An estimated 20% of all workers are employed by the state. As to financing social security programs, Ford said the money will come from selling off government enterprises and property. "But we're not going to give someone $5 to get drunk as a bribe, like Noriega did. People are going to have to work." In this free-market approach, Ford is opposed by Arias Calderon, the nation's other vice president, who prefers more state intervention in a larger, publicly financed welfare system. However, President Endara, whose political background tends to populism and state involvement, has nevertheless allowed Ford a nearly free rein for the time being because the free-market approach is most likely to bring American aid. To Ford, the first step "is to convince the world that we are serious and stable. . . . When they realize we are honest, the investment will come. We may not get back where we were, but we will regain much of our position." Other government economists say they are working on a program to guarantee the safety of foreign investments and to encourage development of Panama's interior, both to diversify the economy and to ease the social services strain on the capital. But Arias, who is supposed to stay out of economic matters and concentrate on restructuring the military and justice systems, extracted at least one concession from Ford. Sources said the first massive government program will be construction of a multimillion-dollar public works project including homes, shops and public offices, in the slum area called Chorrillo, which was nearly destroyed when American troops attacked Noriega's nearby military headquarters. Ford said that banking, long a refuge for foreigners avoiding taxes, will resume without new restrictions; that is, the amounts of deposits and the names of depositors will remain secret. This is another source of conflict with the United States, which wants access to bank records in the search for narcotics traffickers and money launderers. But the major source of differences between Washington and Panama will be the amount of aid and indemnification the United States will pay. "If Ford thinks he can get a billion dollars from us in the next year or so above and beyond the escrow account, he couldn't be more wrong," said a U.S. economic source in a telephone interview from Washington.

Title: FAMILIES BURY TWO SOLDIERS KILLED IN ACTION

Text: The mailman in this tiny northern Pennsylvania hamlet took an hour off Thursday and the manager of the auto parts store locked up at 11 a.m. as hundreds of townspeople paused in their daily toil to say goodby to a fallen son. Staff Sgt. Larry R. Barnard, 29, father of three and husband to his high school sweetheart, Tammy, was killed Dec. 21, the second day of the invasion of Panama. But Panama seemed light years away Thursday from the rolling dairy land along the Susquehanna River. "If Larry ever brought anyone home, it was always someone who was hurting," said the Rev. Keith Benjamin at Barnard's funeral. "Whether he was volunteering to mow lawns for older neighbors or offering some other help, he was the kind of guy who could not pass a person on the street if he saw that they were suffering." At Arlington National Cemetery, across the Potomac River near the nation's capital, Spec. Alejandro I. Manriquelozano, 30, of Lauderhill, Fla., was also buried Thursday. A young man from a Peruvian peasant family, "he was the kind of guy who, if you had no shirt, he would give you his," said his cousin, Jose Canalas of Long Island, N.Y., a hotel manager. The two men were among nearly a dozen American soldiers killed in the U.S. invasion of Panama who were buried this week in ceremonies across the United States. A total of 27 Americans -- 25 servicemen and two civilians -- were reported killed in the fighting, but not all have been officially identified. Manriquelozano was the first Panama casualty to be buried at Arlington. His father, mother and other family members looked on sadly under a bright winter sky. The family was given two American flags and two Purple Hearts by Army officials. Without the means to fly to the United States for the funeral, the family was helped by Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.), who arranged free airline tickets and hotel rooms. Barnard never dreamed of anything but the Army -- "100% Army," as one friend described him a few days after his death. He volunteered for service after he finished high school and eventually became a Ranger, a high-profile job that led to his participation in the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983. Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey had visited the Barnard family and President Bush sent Maj. Gen. Paul Cerjan to express his country's condolences. But the real message was the 400 people -- seemingly the entire town -- who gathered in the new-fallen snow at the United Methodist Church here for the funeral. "Thank you all so much for coming," were the only words Barnard's older brother, Ray, could manage. His father, Ray Sr., simply broke into tears, clutching the tri-folded U.S. flag presented to him by the military. "His parents were always apprehensive (of his military work), but they were very aware and very proud of the fact that (the Army) was of his choosing," said Trudy Zurn, a family friend. "The thing helping the (Barnard) family at this point has simply been their faith in God," she said. "The family has chosen not to comment on the activities in Panama." At the age of 25, Manriquelozano had left Peru and emigrated to Florida. He had hoped to become a U.S. citizen. He enlisted in the Army two years ago. According to family members, he hoped to earn a college degree in civil engineering with the help of the military and remain in the Army as a career officer. On Dec. 16, four days before the invasion of Panama, the 30-year-old soldier called his father in Peru and told him that the United States was planning to invade Panama. "He couldn't talk too much," said Canalas, the cousin. "And he didn't want his mother to know. He thought she would worry." Manriquelozano's unit parachuted into Panama City's Torrijos Airport and immediately engaged in a fierce firefight. Ripped by machine-gun fire almost as he touched the ground, Manriquelozano was killed instantly, the family said. The circumstances of Barnard's death still are unclear. Stewart reported from Hallstead, Pa., and Soble from Arlington National Cemetery.

Title: 200 GRIEVE IN ORANGE COUNTY FOR SOLDIER, 19
Author: TONY MARCANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: CASUALTIES; ARMY (U.S.) -- PERSONNEL; FUNERALS; UNITED STATES -- ARMED FORCES -- PANAMA; NORIEGA, MANUEL A; PANAMA -- REVOLTS
Text: Led in prayer by a Baptist minister who urged them to "criticize the Noriegas," hundreds of mourners gathered Thursday at a funeral for Army Pfc. Roy Dennis Brown Jr., killed last week in the early stages of the conflict in Panama. Brown, 19, who would have returned to his Buena Park home on New Year's leave Thursday, was instead eulogized as an Army Ranger who fought "through hell." In a graveside ceremony, Brown was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart. "As recently as December the 20th (when Brown died), your freedom and my freedom was protected by the blood of this, our brother in Christ," the Rev. Wiley Drake, pastor of the First Southern Baptist Church in Buena Park, told more than 200 friends and relatives who packed the Pierce Brothers Daly-Bartel-Spencer Chapel in Anaheim. Drake urged the mourners not to criticize the invasion of Panama that was ordered by President Bush -- whom Drake called "Roy's commander in chief" -- but to blame the reasons why it was necessary. "If we are quick to criticize, if we're quick to ask why, let us criticize the Noriegas, let us criticize the drug lords, as Roy did and would, let us criticize those that would end our freedoms and let us criticize those that would poison our young people," Drake said. Other speakers remembered not the soldier, but the young Orange County man they knew. "He had an impish smile, sort of a . . . not a Dennis the Menace smile, sort of like Opie (a character on the old 'Andy Griffith Show')," said John Halsey, band director at Magnolia High School in Anaheim, where Brown once played trombone. "He had a lot of funny antics, but I can't share them all here now because some of his teachers may be here." Brown's maternal aunt and uncle, Mimi and Bill Campbell of Darby, Mont., also recalled their nephew as a youngster who was full of life and was given to occasional practical jokes. "Roy was really a special baby -- he was quick to come into the world," Mimi Campbell said. "It was a short 8 1/2-minute delivery, as if he was in a hurry to do what he had to do. More than 70 years he packed into 19 years of life. "I look at Roy's life like an unfrosted cake," she said. "It didn't need the icing because it was wholesome and good just as it was." Although Halsey and the Campbells occasionally smiled while recalling memories of the young man, they all fought back tears as they concluded their eulogies. After the service, a police motorcycle escort led the mourners in a long funeral procession to Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in east Orange. At the hillside grave site, with a backdrop of mountains crowned by gray skies, a time-honored military ceremony was enacted when a seven-member honor guard fired three volleys, and a lone bugler played taps. Six soldiers then folded the flag that draped Brown's coffin and handed it to his mother, Julie Otto. The ceremony concluded with Maj. Gen. Todd Graham, deputy commander of the 6th Army based at the Presidio in San Francisco, handing Otto her son's Purple Heart.

Title: ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON VATICAN; DIPLOMACY: OFFICIALS ARE GATHERING NEW EVIDENCE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE THE POPE TO TURN NORIEGA OVER TO THE U.S.

Text: The Bush Administration is seeking to increase pressure on the Vatican to turn deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega over to the United States and plans to present new evidence of his alleged crimes to papal authorities in Rome, officials said Thursday. U.S. Army officials are gathering documents and other evidence from the Panamanian general's many homes in Panama, and Justice Department investigators are questioning a former Noriega aide in Miami, all with a view to "building a stronger case" that might persuade Pope John Paul II to expel the deposed dictator from the Vatican embassy, the officials said. They said they also are exploring possible terms for a deal under which the Vatican could deliver Noriega formally into the hands of the new government of Panama and the Panamanian regime would immediately turn the general over to the United States. Noriega spent his fifth day Thursday inside the Vatican's embassy, where he took refuge from invading U.S. troops on Christmas Eve. The United States has asked the Vatican to turn him over for trial in the United States on drug-trafficking charges, but Wednesday the Pope's official spokesman rejected the request. "We think we have a strong case, and it may get stronger as time goes on," a senior U.S. official involved with the case said. "A common criminal is not entitled to diplomatic sanctuary. If we get more evidence to present to the Vatican that he's wanted for ordinary crimes -- that this is not a political case -- it will strengthen our position." Included in the evidence being prepared, he said, is testimony from Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, a former Noriega aide who surrendered to the U.S. Army after the invasion. At the same time, officials said that the strain of playing host to Noriega may prompt the papal nuncio in Panama, Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, to appeal to the pontiff for a resolution. "He (Noriega) is a very unwelcome guest," said one official. "Just look at the letter," he added. The reference was to a letter Laboa wrote authorizing the U.S. Army to intervene if any Vatican embassy employees were taken hostage by Noriega or others who have taken refuge there. As further evidence that the Vatican may be persuaded to change its mind, officials also noted that the Roman Catholic primate of Panama, Archbishop Marcos G. McGrath, has recommended that Noriega be turned over to the United States. May Tire of Embassy Besides, one official added, Noriega -- known to be a bon vivant and raconteur -- may tire of the church's hospitality. "Does he really want to be stuck in a monastery for two months?" There is some hope, he said, for "an unexpected event" -- like Noriega suddenly deciding either to give up or to attempt to escape on his own. One reason U.S. forces outside the nunciature in Panama have been playing rock music at high volume, he noted, is to increase Noriega's discomfort. The officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, emphasized that the Administration is sticking to its position of demanding Noriega's release to U.S. authorities, and the issue may take weeks to resolve. "We're not near any quick breakthrough," a senior official said. ". . . We're nowhere near the end game." Indeed, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater appeared to harden the Administration's position Thursday, saying that the United States could not accept a deal that would give Noriega refuge in another country because of the heavy price the United States has paid for his ouster. Last spring, as U.S. officials despaired of deposing Noriega, the Panamanian leader was encouraged to voluntarily leave Panama for a third country, with the understanding that he would not be extradited to the United States. Such an offer is no longer on the table, said Fitzwater, who is traveling with the vacationing President Bush in Texas. Officials said they are confident that the Panamanian government would find a way to turn Noriega over to the United States if the Vatican decides to deliver the general to local authorities. "Panama has been pretty flexible," said one. "There are many ways of bringing this to a resolution. He can be turned over or surrendered or declared a detainee of U.S. forces. . . ." Panama's constitution prohibits the extradition of a Panamanian citizen to a foreign country. But officials said that the government there could hand Noriega over without formally invoking the extradition process, thus sidestepping the constitutional issue. The Vatican's diplomatic missions around the world, like other embassies, have long been sanctuaries for those fleeing political or religious persecution. Under accepted international law, foreign embassies cannot be entered by police or armed forces seeking to seize refugees. The Times reported Thursday, however, that Laboa, the Vatican's diplomatic representative in Panama City, had granted authority to the U.S. Army to take the necessary steps to free any Vatican embassy personnel taken hostage by Noriega or anyone else. Asked whether the Administration sees a serious threat of hostage-taking, Fitzwater said: "We have no indication there is trouble within the nunciature. There are no hostages we are aware of." But, he said, he assumed that the letter granting the unusual authority to the Army had been written because "when you have people of the ilk of Mr. Noriega and his cronies, there certainly is reason to be concerned. If there is any danger there, we would be prepared to offer assistance." Fitzwater added that Bush had not spoken with the Pope about Noriega. "We think it's appropriate that we not try to intervene in a way not appropriate to the decision-making process," he said. Times staff writer James Gerstenzang contributed to this report from Texas.

Abstract: MYSTERIES; ASTRONOMY
Text: A large, greenish fireball flashed across the sky at high altitude Thursday evening, putting on a celestial display visible from the Grand Canyon to San Diego, authorities said. Pilots flying between 13,000 feet and 35,000 feet reported seeing the fireball over Arizona and Nevada, Federal Aviation Administration officials said. Coast Guard officials in Long Beach said they had received reports of sightings from San Diego to Santa Barbara. A spokesman at Griffith Observatory said they did not have sufficient information to determine what caused the fireball.

Title: OFFICER SOUGHT IN $247,500 LOSS NABBED BY NAVY; MANHUNT: TRIP TO A NORFOLK, VA., BAR WAS A MISTAKE FOR A MISSING LIEUTENANT WHO IS SUSPECTED OF TAKING FUNDS FROM A SAN DIEGO-BASED SHIP.
Author: NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: After three months of sleuthing, Navy officials have caught an officer who disappeared a month before $247,500 turned up missing from the San Diego-based Tuscaloosa, a tank landing ship. Lt. Bradley Scott Darr, 31, was arrested Wednesday night in Norfolk, Va., after a Naval Investigative Services agent noticed him in a local bar on Christmas. The agent left the bar, however, thinking that Darr looked familiar but not remembering why. In his office the following day, the agent scanned photographs of individuals sought by the Navy and realized he had seen Darr. Since Christmas, NIS agents have been searching Norfolk for Darr, a disbursing officer who once handled payroll and purchasing and had access to $1.2 million aboard ship. Wednesday night, 20 agents went to area nightclubs and found Darr, a North Carolina native. Darr said he had financial problems caused by gambling, according to NIS spokesman Michael G. Bourke, who said agents believed Darr was in Norfolk because his credit card had been used there in recent weeks. "This was good sound investigative techniques and dogged persistence by the Naval Investigative Services," said Rick Machin, deputy regional director for the NIS mid-Atlantic region. "We put shoe leather to the street." Agents also found more than $130,000 of the missing money, Machin said. Darr is being held in Norfolk while authorities decide whether to hold a trial in Virginia or San Diego. Darr will probably be charged with desertion and theft of government funds, sources said. Desertion alone is punishable by up to five years in prison. Darr, who worked in Las Vegas casinos before enlisting three years ago, had failed to report for duty when he was assigned to an naval air station in Italy Aug. 23. One month later, he was declared a deserter. Then, after a routine audit in September, officials realized that ship funds were also missing. Aboard many ships, sailors are paid in cash because they spend long stretches at sea and are rarely in a port long enough to establish a bank account. The Tuscaloosa, which has a 340-member crew, can also house and transport 349 troops. Darr, a supply corps officer, could cash and write checks for those aboard. Officials said a payroll officer could have written a single check for $247,500, called ahead to the bank so that the cash was waiting for him, and picked up the money later. "As disbursing officer, he had the opportunity to make the books balance," Machin said. For NIS agents, involved in the case since Sept. 25, finding Darr concludes what has been a tough case -- trying to locate a man who could be anywhere in the world. "We were just talking about ol' Bradley and wondering what he was going to do for Christmas," Bourke said. "Then just by fate, some guy sees him. It was a lot of good investigative work. And sometimes in law enforcement, it's a lot of luck."

Title: 4 DIE IN FREEWAY COLLISION WITH TANKER
Author: SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS -- SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY
Text: Four people were killed when a Chevrolet Blazer slammed into a jackknifed gasoline tanker on the San Bernardino Freeway in Claremont late Wednesday, causing a fiery explosion that left authorities with few leads Thursday as to the victims' identities. A 36-year-old Glendora woman, whose name was not released, was believed to be at the wheel of the Blazer when it hit the twin tanker, authorities said. The three other victims also were riding in the vehicle, police said. It will be several days before a comparison of dental records can be made to confirm the identities of the four people who were trapped in the flaming vehicle, Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said. The tanker driver, Linzell Washington, 52, of La Puente, was uninjured in the crash, which occurred at 11:25 p.m. Wednesday. The inferno closed the freeway in both directions for several hours. Washington told CHP officers that he was driving westbound at about 55 m.p.h. when the tanker's brakes locked and spun the rig out of control, stopping about 200 feet east of Indian Hill Boulevard, CHP spokesman Dennis Paulson said. The spin-out left the tanker jackknifed, straddling three lanes of the freeway, with the cab's headlights pointed northeast. Paulson theorized that the driver of the oncoming Blazer "could have been distracted by the headlights" of the tanker. Washington had left his cab to check on the damage when the Blazer struck the rear tank of the rig. The spectacular fire that followed left authorities with few leads in trying to determine the victims' identities. The identification of the 36-year-old Glendora woman could only be described as "tentative." Firefighters needed an hour to extinguish the blaze. Officials estimated the tanker had been carrying 20,000 gallons of gasoline. Both directions of the freeway were closed between Indian Hill Boulevard in Claremont and Central Avenue in Montclair until 4:30 a.m., when eastbound lanes were opened. The westbound lanes were opened at 6:45 a.m. A CHP spokeswoman said it is believed that the other three victims were two teen-age boys and a child about 10 years of age. The younger child's sex was unknown, the spokesman said. Dambacher, however, indicated that the victims included the Glendora woman, an adult male and a teen-age boy and girl.

Title: GOLD ROBBERY POSES BIG CHALLENGE FOR DETECTIVES
Author: DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: ROBBERIES -- LOS ANGELES; GOLD; JEWELRY; POLICE INVESTIGATIONS
Text: "How about the nose?" Police Detective Emmett G. Badar asked. An intense Khatchik Djigardjian, whose wholesale jewelry company had been hit the day before by a team of armed robbers, studied the crude beginnings of a composite picture of one suspect. The detective prodded him. "A broader nose? Skinnier nose? Longer nose?" "I don't remember that nose," Djigardjian said finally. Scarcely 24 hours after Djigardjian and six others were handcuffed and gagged by two intruders who threatened to shoot them, Los Angeles Police Department investigators were on the trail Thursday at Djigardjian's Rope Mine Corp. in the city's vast jewelry district. The case promised to be a challenging whodunnit. It was Djigardjian, 42, who opened the door to the robbers in the belief that they were customers. They made off with an estimated $1 million. But Djigardjian said he could not recall the taller suspect at all. He was hazy about the shorter one, recalling the man's eyes, hair and lips, but not his nose, forehead or sideburns. "It was so fast," Djigardjian said with frustration. "I cannot say, 'That's him, go and get him.' " Detectives said the robbery, the largest in the jewelry district in years, could take months to solve -- if indeed it is ever solved. But they said a rough composite sketch, fingerprints from the scene and a fuzzy videotape taken from a security camera in the lobby of the jewelry building had provided a good start. In the days ahead, investigators said, they hope that laboratory analyses will determine exactly what fingerprints they have, enabling them to run a computer search to try to match them to identities. They also hope that artificial enhancement of the videotape or improvements in Djigardjian's composite picture will give them a passable image of one suspect, a balding, thick-lipped man who was described as Asian or Middle-Eastern. Badar, a detective for 18 years, punctuated an hour of tedious questioning by asking Djigardjian if he could recognize the suspect in a police lineup. "Sure," the company owner said. The detective said vital information was somewhere in Djigardjian's memory. "We have to get it out," Badar said patiently. "All the questions are directed at one thing -- to get something out of you that you don't realize you remember." Before leaving Rope Mine Corp.'s offices at 610 S. Broadway, detectives conceded that they face potential roadblocks. It is possible -- perhaps even likely -- that the suspects have fled town. The stolen gold -- in the form of 24-carat gold dust, 14-carat bars and 14-carat jewelry chain -- is easily transported or sold. "No way to trace it," Detective C. E. Gordon said. Sources within the nation's second-largest jewelry district said it is possible that the gold already is changing hands in other forms. "I would guess that anybody who took this material will just melt it down into ingots . . . and sell it as scrap," said Nelson Colton of A-Mark Precious Metals Inc., a leading wholesaler. "Gold melts at a reasonably low temperature. You can almost melt gold in your kitchen." Actually, it would require a hot furnace to bring the metal to its 1,900-degree melting point, but professional refiners routinely carry out such work in large cities. Once melted, the same gold could be sold for more than 95% of its market value -- $406 an ounce on Thursday -- at any number of small shops in the jewelry district that advertise that they buy gold, Colton said. "You can go down to the Hill Street area, you'll probably see a lot of signs of people who will buy gold," he said. Police, however, said the gold's liquidity should not jeopardize the hunt. "It would be nice to (recover) some of the property, but it's not necessary," said LAPD Lt. Robert Kurth, the commanding officer handling the investigation. "What we need for successful prosecution is to establish that the crime was committed and that those (suspects) are the people who committed the crime." Insiders believe that the robbery was carried out by men with at least some knowledge of the jewelry trade. If that is true, police hope the composite picture will be recognized by someone within the district, where about 2,000 merchants, wholesalers and manufacturers occupy about a dozen high-rise buildings, regularly buying and selling from each other. "These guys all know each other," Badar said. "It's a very close-knit community." Moussa Hassid, business manager of the Los Angeles Jewelry Center, a building that contains about 200 different jewelers, said it is true that "a lot of people in the trade . . . know almost everybody." On the other hand, new faces enter the district daily, he said. The thieves easily could be from jewelry centers elsewhere. "This is a big country," Hassid said. "You have so many jewelry districts throughout the United States." Kurth said police already are asking law-enforcement agencies nationwide for information that might turn up. Conceivably, he said, the same two robbers are wanted for crimes elsewhere, where perhaps their identities are known. If investigators get lucky, they may be apprehended on some unrelated charge, found out and extradited to California. "It could take anywhere from a few days," Kurth said of the hunt, "to a few years."

Text: State agriculture officials said Thursday that they have discovered a fertile Mediterranean fruit fly in Monrovia and will add nearly 20 square miles to the area to be sprayed with the pesticide malathion next month. A mated female fly was found in an area north of Foothill Boulevard near Buena Vista Street, which was just outside the spray zone in the Monrovia area, said Don Henry, spokesman for the Medfly eradication project. The area has been added to the spray zone that is to be treated with malathion Jan. 11. The discovery brings the spray zone area to nearly 300 square miles. The find also broke a two-week period of relative calm in the Medfly battle, during which few discoveries were made and agriculture officials began to predict that the infestation would soon be under control.

Title: ELABORATE RITES PLANNED FOR SLAIN DOG
Author: AMY LOUISE KAZMIN and PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS
Abstract: SHOOTINGS -- LOS ANGELES; POSTAL WORKERS; ANIMAL DEATHS; PETS; DOGS; FUNERALS
Text: An Arleta family whose 2-year-old mixed German shepherd, Skippy, was reportedly shot to death by a postman made preparations Thursday for an elaborate funeral that will include a silk-lined casket, graveside ceremony and headstone at a pet cemetery in Calabasas. The funeral is slated for 3:30 p.m. Wednesday. As a U.S. Postal Service official indicated Thursday that the agency would pick up tabs for the dog's funeral, a check of San Fernando Municipal Court records indicated that mail carrier Floyd Bertran Sterling, 34, who was accused by the Brody family of shooting the dog, was already on probation for a 1988 misdemeanor conviction for carrying a loaded .44 magnum revolver in his car. During the 1988 incident, an officer stopped Sterling for speeding and turning left in front of oncoming traffic, according to a police report on file. Noticing targets in the back of the car, the officer asked Sterling if he was carrying a gun. Sterling, who was on his way home from a firing range, showed the officer his loaded revolver in its case and was arrested. He pleaded no contest to the charges in December, 1988, and was sentenced to two years' probation and fined $150. On Tuesday, according to Skippy's owner, Tammie Brody, 27, Sterling "freaked out" and shot the dog, who she said was not menacing him, just as Brody emerged from her house to give the mail carrier a Christmas present, a bottle of vodka wrapped with a green ribbon bow. Sterling, who told police Skippy had bitten him earlier, was arrested after the shooting but released. LAPD Detective Manford Brown said police will ask the district attorney's office today to charge Sterling with cruelty to an animal. Sterling also faces possible action by the Post Office for violating regulations that prohibit workers from carrying firearms on the job. The Postal Service placed Sterling on paid leave while it investigates. "Everyone's very sorry about it," said John Conte, communications manager for the U.S. Postal Service division in Van Nuys, as he announced that the federal agency will pay for Skippy's funeral. "It's an unfortunate situation," Conte said. "We're willing to do what we can to alleviate the situation." Skippy will be laid to rest in a deluxe, 40-inch lined casket banked by flowers at Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park, said Laura Ortega, a spokeswoman for the pet cemetery. He has been given a burial plot next to Whiskey, a German shepherd which belonged to Brody's brother. Ortega said the bill for funeral services had reached $531.50 and was still climbing. Brody said she wants a fancy ceremony to help her 10-year-old son Brian get over the trauma of witnessing the killing of his pet. Brody said her son would probably say a few words of farewell before the casket is lowered into the ground. The dog "certainly didn't die in a nice way," Brody said. "If he could be buried in a nice way," perhaps her son "could just go on and not dwell on it," Brody said. Meanwhile, neighbors living on Sterling's route in Arleta rallied around the postman whom they described as "friendly." "I really think the dog had it coming," said John Tween, 42. "That dog was always out in the street chasing cars." Beth Adams, 30, another neighbor, said: "He's very warm. He's a nice guy, and I personally think this dog must have done something to him." Adams said she contacted the Post Office to offer money to go toward a legal fund and to act as a character witness in Sterling's defense.

Title: CHAMINADE TOURNAMENT; BENCH PICKS UP THE SLACK IN SIMI VALLEY VICTORY
Author: JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: With two starters slowed by illness, Simi Valley High needed a lift from its bench Thursday in the Chaminade tournament. And the Pioneers received one from James Krevitz and Mike Baity en route to a 67-48 win over Chatsworth. The victory gave Simi Valley (7-4) a 2-0 record in its pool and a berth in the championship bracket, where it will meet Chaminade at 6 p.m. today. Simi Valley starters Steve Carnes and Mike Wawryk were slowed by the flu, but the Pioneers' bench provided help that allowed the pair some time of their own on the bench for much-needed rest. "They (the reserves) have to produce right now," Coach Dean Bradshaw said. "They can't come into a game and turn the ball over or miss two or three shots." That wasn't a problem Thursday. Krevitz, who finished with eight points, contributed two three-point baskets in the second quarter that helped loosen Chatsworth's zone defense. Baity contributed 10 points and five rebounds. Carnes still managed to finish with 18 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Kenny Hood scored 12 points and grabbed 12 rebounds -- including six offensive boards. Chris Dunbar scored 16 points and Delvon Hardaway added 11 for Chatsworth (3-5), which lost both of its pool games and was eliminated. In other tournament games: Fairfax 91, Burbank 38 -- Fairfax bombed Burbank, 20-4, in the first quarter and never looked back in a second-round game in pool play. Paul Tapp led Burbank (1-9), which was eliminated, with 12 points. Senior center Ryan Hickman of Fairfax led all scorers with 21 points. Chaminade 88, Camp Kilpatrick 43 -- All five Chaminade starters scored in double figures, led by Charlie Fei (19 points) and Mark Mirkovich (15). Santa Monica 69, Granada Hills 64 -- Granada Hills was held to nine points in the first quarter and never recovered, despite 20 points from senior guard Jermoine Brantley. Aaron Lattimore added 16 points for Granada Hills (6-6).

Title: THOUSAND OAKS GIRLS' TOURNAMENT; PALMDALE'S COUPLAND THROTTLES PALMISANO
Author: JIM COLEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES
Abstract: null
Text: Identify the player: Power forward. Wears goggles. Plays for a team that has won several league championships during the 1980s. James Worthy, perhaps? Try Nicole Coupland, 5-foot-10 senior forward for the Palmdale High girls' basketball team. Coupland gave a defensive performance worthy of recognition Thursday night, shutting down Thousand Oaks' Michelle Palmisano in Palmdale's 52-46 win over the Lancers (7-5) in the Thousand Oaks tournament. Palmdale (11-2) moves into Saturday's championship final against Westlake. Thursday's meeting was the third this season between Palmdale and Thousand Oaks, and the Lancers are once, twice, three times a loser. The sharp-shooting Palmisano, who had 39 and 21 points in the two previous defeats, scored a game-high 20 this time but was made just five of 15 attempts from the field under duress from Coupland and the double-teaming Falcons. Palmdale never trailed after taking the lead late in the first period. The Falcons, who forced 29 turnovers, led, 29-20, at halftime and, 40-30, after three periods. But led by a determined Palmisano, who scored eight of her points in the fourth quarter, Thousand Oaks made a late charge, closing to 48-44 on a jump shot by the sophomore guard. But that's as close as the Lancers could get. Palmdale got two free throws by Kim Schielke and a layup by Coupland to pull away at the end. Martania Blair led Palmdale with 17 points and 14 rebounds. Karee Bonde and Schielke chipped in with 12 and 10 points for the Falcons. Thousand Oaks got 12 points from Suzanne Nelinger and 13 rebounds from Palmisano. In other tournament games: Westlake 64, Channel Islands 57 -- Westlake (10-1) converted 11 of 14 free throws in the fourth quarter to hold off Channel Islands (9-4) and advance to Saturday's championship game. The Warriors used just five players until Dani O'Byrne fouled out with nine seconds to play. O'Byrne led Westlake with 18 points, including five of seven from the line in the fourth period. Tracy Thorp (16 points), Melissa Gische (15) and Lauren Goldstine (13) also scored in double figures for Westlake, which held the Raiders to five-of-16 shooting in the fourth period. Channel Islands' Candis Carper led all scorers with 21 points. Notre Dame 51, Nordhoff 43 -- Julie Nelson and Shannon McGlothlin scored 16 and 14 points to lead Notre Dame into the consolation final against Pasadena. Pasadena 71, El Camino Real 51 -- Anita Bilbowssian scored 28 points, including nine three-point baskets, to deny El Camino Real a berth in the consolation final. Nicole Nelson (14 points), Cathy Balint (13) and Angela Rich (10) all scored in double figures for El Camino Real.

Title: HART TOURNAMENT; PAEZ POURS OUT JUSTIFICATION FOR HIGH SCORES
Author: VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: Cleveland High basketball team routs opponent. Opponent's coach accuses Cleveland coach of pouring it on. Cleveland coach responds in "Who, me?" fashion. New year, new coach, but same old story for Cleveland. The longtime Valley powerhouse pounded Beverly Hills, 102-73, Thursday in a quarterfinal-round game of the Hart tournament. Beverly Hills Coach Jack Dyck, thinking aloud through much of the debacle, took exception to the Cavaliers' application of a full-court press while the game was under lock and key late in the fourth quarter. "That's kind of a Cleveland tradition from what I understand," Dyck said. "Keep stepping on them when they're down." Marc Paez, the new coach, indicated that this is not the same old Cleveland. Paez, who replaced Bob Braswell, the target of repeated pointed fingers in his four-year reign, insisted that he is not one to tread on anyone's toes -- or team, for that matter. "I'm sorry he felt that we poured it on," Paez said. "I'm very conscious of that and I don't want to be thought of as one who runs up scores. I think we called it off at the six-minute mark of the fourth quarter. But you can only take the kids out of the press. You can't take the aggressiveness out of the kids. They've earned their right to play hard." Paez pointed to the employment of reserves Reggie Simmons (six points), Sean Guenther (four) and David Garrett (two), all of whom accounted for their scoring totals in the fourth quarter while starters Brandon Martin (game-high 23 points), Bobby McRae (16), Eddie Hill (12), Andre Chevalier (10), and sixth man Patrick McCook (17) became spectators. Cleveland (8-4) got rolling early, making 21 of 37 shots from the field to take a 52-36 halftime lead. McCook scored 10 points in the second quarter, and Martin scored eight in the second and nine in the third to complete his scoring. In other tournament games: Antelope Valley 103, St. Francis 93 -- The Antelopes (9-2) raced to their eighth consecutive win while receiving a career-high 36-point performance from senior Chris Walters. Hart 95, Saugus 67 -- Micah Ohlman scored a game-high 32 points to lead Hart into a semifinal game against Rio Mesa. Rio Mesa 69, East Bakersfield 55 -- Eric Thomas scored a game-high 29 points as the Spartans advanced to the championship semifinal. Palmdale 63, Hueneme 44 -- Palmdale stretched a 30-24 halftime lead by outscoring Hueneme, 18-4, in the third quarter in a consolation quarterfinal. Junior center Jason Grimes scored a game-high 16 points to pace Palmdale (6-6). Calabasas 58, St. Genevieve 28 -- Guards John Friedlander (15 points) and Brian Firring (14) teamed to lead the Coyotes in a consolation quarterfinal. Canyon 79, Steveston, British Columbia, Canada 44 -- Tom Boobar scored a team-high 16 points to lead Canyon in a consolation quarterfinal game. Crescenta Valley 53, Glendale 47 -- Jon Allen and Bruce Jacobson each scored 10 points as Crescenta Valley advanced to the consolation semifinals.

Title: HART SOCCER TOURNAMENT; CAMARILLO TO STAY FOR FINAL AFTER JOINING AS LATE ENTRY
Author: MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES
Abstract: null
Text: The Camarillo High boys' soccer team would have been home for the holidays had it not been for St. Bonaventure's inability to field a team. Camarillo Coach John Alfino received a phone call from Hart tournament officials Dec. 21 asking the Scorpions to fill the vacancy left after the Seraphs withdrew from the tournament. After a 1-0 victory over Newbury Park in a semifinal match Thursday, Camarillo will play for the tournament championship against San Fernando today at 2 p.m. "It's kind of ironic," Alfino said. "We weren't in this thing a week ago and now we're in the final. "If we wind up winning this thing they might be sorry they let us in." Newbury Park, a Marmonte League rival of Camarillo, was not at full strength. The Panthers (8-3) had only nine of their 18 players, forcing Coach Ben Buttner to bring up six players from the junior varsity. "Our whole defense has gone skiing," Buttner said. 'I think we can take Camarillo when we have the rest of our team." Camarillo (7-0) broke a scoreless tie with four minutes to play when left wing Chris Sampson took a head shot from six yards off Marcus Hanson's crossing pass. Sampson's shot, just out of the reach of Newbury Park goalkeeper John Casarietti, found the upper-right corner of the net. Newbury Park took just six shots on goal, and Buttner said in order for his team to score one or two goals in a match, it has to take about 20 shots. In other matches: San Fernando 2, Hart 1 -- Midfielder Marco Zanbrano scored with 10 minutes left to snap a 1-1 deadlock and lift the Tigers (7-0-2) into the tournament final. Trailing, 1-0, at halftime, San Fernando tied the score, 1-1, in the second half on forward Fabian Galvan's goal at the 15-minute mark. Striker David Rosales had scored with five minutes to play in the half to give Hart (4-1-1) a 1-0 lead. San Fernando played a man short for most of the second half. Tereso Delgado received consecutive yellow cards -- which constitutes a red card -- and was ejected at the five-minute mark. Harvard 2, Palmdale 1 -- The Falcons led, 1-0, at halftime but Harvard scored two goals in the first nine minutes of the second half in the fifth-place game. Midfielder Scott Malin scored from 20 yards on a rebound shot to tie the score, 1-1, at the seven-minute mark. Two minutes later, midfielder Aristides Alberto, on an assist from Jerome Schwartz, put the Saracens (8-2-2) ahead to stay. Canyon 3, Victor Valley 0 -- Forward Jeff Ferguson scored goals at the two- and 28-minute marks in the first half to pace the Cowboys (3-3) in a fifth-place semifinal. Canyon goalkeeper Chris Littleford made 10 saves. Alemany 1, Granada Hills 0 -- After playing to a 0-0 tie in regulation, fullback Marcus Bradley scored the winning goal in a shoot-out to lift the Indians (6-1-1) into the consolation championship against Quartz Hill. Quartz Hill 1, Hollywood 0 -- Forward Bryon Richards scored in a shoot-out.

Title: JIM MURRAY: THEY KNEW HOW TO KEEP TRACK OF THE LATEST NEWS
Author: JIM MURRAY
Abstract: UNITED STATES -- FOREIGN RELATIONS -- USSR; USSR -- ATHLETICS; ATKINSON, JEFF; ESPIONAGE -- UNITED STATES; OLYMPIC GAMES; ATHLETES; UNITED STATES ATHLETIC TEAMS; TRACK AND FIELD
Text: Our government spends -- what? -- billions on espionage? I mean, spies, satellites, moles, the CIA, the FBI, wire taps, covert operations, electronic surveillance, ships off the coast, secret documents, false passports. You name it. Bah! All they have to do is debrief our track and field athletes. You know the breakup of the Iron Curtain bloc we've been reading about for weeks now? Caught our government by surprise, did it? Not Jeff Atkinson, the miler. Hardly any of the high jumpers, long jumpers, pole vaulters, discus throwers and low hurdlers. You see, they could see it coming without going anywhere in false whiskers, tapping phone lines, bribing a guard or even leveling a telescope across a barbed-wire fence. All they had to do was say out loud, "Hey, Ivan, feel like going out for a Coke?" Or, "Say, Greta, how's about we go shopping for a pair of designer jeans together?" When they got the answer, "Sure!" they knew the Berlin Wall was coming down. Followed shortly by the Iron Curtain. They knew it when the athletes from the socialist strand of countries started to act like people instead of robots. They didn't need coded messages, dead-letter drops from agents in place. All they needed was a smile -- and a rock record. You know, when the Soviet Union first rejoined the Olympic movement in 1952, they really didn't. They were an island in the middle of the Olympic ideal. Their athletes were sealed off in their own dormitories. They were escorted everywhere by KGB heavies. Their quarters were off-limits to western athletes, journalists, even officials. They were never part of the camaraderie. Even in their home country, in the Moscow Olympics, soldiers with submachine guns stood guard over their facilities. They were in the Olympics but not of it. So, Atkinson, who is one of our better milers, comes off like 007 James Bond in a track suit. "It was in Tokyo, we began to notice it. The Eastern athletes were, all of a sudden, all over the hotels. We went bowling with them, had Cokes with them. You exchanged rings, swapped clothes. And without reprisals. They tell me that in past years when swapping went on, their officers made them return all the clothing and then kept them under guard the rest of the trips. "We knew something was up when they began to mingle." Jeff should have wired his government's embassy in East Berlin: "Take a look out the window, our intelligence indicates guys will soon be on it with jackhammers." He could have predicted Hungary was going western by the attitude of the female hurdlers. When it happened over there, it was like the spring breakup on the Yukon. But Jeff -- and the rest of our traveling troupe of athletes -- were less surprised than the State Department. For Atkinson and the rest of America's Olympians, the news is all good for another non-political reason. The fall of the state dictatorships may mean a significant decrease in the cheating going on -- a decline in the use of performance-enhancing drugs, blood doping and other win-at-all-costs tactics. The state will feel it has less of a vested interest in victory and turn the Games back into sports and not political skirmishes. "To me," Atkinson said, "it was like putting on roller skates. Not a part of the purpose of sport, at all. It was taking an extraordinary risk for a very small reward. I like to think it will disappear with the Wall." Jeff Atkinson was something of an international surprise himself. A one-time cross-country runner from Stanford with only so-so credentials, he startled the world of track and field in 1988 when he not only made the Olympic team in the 1,500 meters but won the trial. "I was a slow, shuffling 10K-type of runner," he said. "My average 10,000 was 30 minutes, then I found I was running two miles in 9:06. I thought, whoa, I might be concentrating on the wrong event. Besides, as a miler, I could make the traveling squad. As a long-distance runner, I couldn't." He found he liked being what he called a "mid-foot" runner -- "All the great long-distance runners like Frank Shorter are toe runners." He also liked being able to utilize a kick, or a late-race sprint, at which he found out he excelled. All his years of long-distance running, he put to good use. Fifteen-hundred meters was like a day in the park after years of 20,000. His progress was steady but not spectacular, hampered by kneecap tears, but he set a program for himself that called for: "The (Olympic) Trials in '84, the team in '88, the medal in '92." So far, he is right on schedule. He made the trials in Los Angeles but rapped out in the heats. He not only made the trials in Indianapolis in '88, he won. He made the finals at Seoul, and his 10th place was not so bad as it seemed. He was second in a heat to the eventual winner, Peter Rono. He was fifth in the semifinal, and his finish was due to a rash but understandable piece of strategy. "I could have finished fifth if I had run conservatively but I moved up to take on Rono because, in an Olympics, if you don't medal, it doesn't matter where you finish." America's performance in the Olympic metric mile has been a sorry one. We have not won this race since 1908. We have sent world record-holders to the Games, we have sent world-class milers by the dozen, but we have managed only three second places in 80 years -- Abel Kiviat, Glenn Cunningham and Jim Ryun. Atkinson will be 29 in the Barcelona Olympics. It is an age at which, in the old days, Olympic-class runners in this country would have long since given up their skivvies for a three-piece suit and a briefcase and a seat on the 8:02 commuter. But our athletes no longer have to quit just as they're coming into their own. Atkinson's campaign for the '92 Olympics will kick off in the 31st annual Sunkist Invitational meet at the Sports Arena on Jan. 19, when he will not only be meeting one of his chief rivals for the gold in Barcelona, Abdi Bile of Somalia, but will be taking a shot at a special $100,000 prize posted by sponsors for anyone breaking the world indoor record in the mile. Atkinson is impatient to get going. "I'm right on track," he insists. "I wasn't supposed to make the trials in '84, I wasn't supposed to make the team in '88 and I'm not supposed to medal in '92." The State Department better hope he does. Who knows? He might be able to come home and tell them what the Chinese are going to do next.

Title: CLIPPERS JUMP ON WARRIORS; PRO BASKETBALL: IT'S AN INSIDE JOB AS 45-20 FIRST QUARTER TURNS INTO 139-119 ROMP. GOLDEN STATE COACH NELSON IS EJECTED.
Author: SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: Maybe the idea from now on is to make sure the game doesn't come down to a referee's call. "I know everybody was thinking that," Gary Grant said. "Nobody was saying that, but we were thinking it." Stung by another controversial loss in their last outing, the Clippers all but eliminated the possibility of official intervention in the first quarter Thursday night against Golden State. They followed that with 36 more minutes of solid play to rout the Warriors, 139-119, before 10,014 at the Sports Arena. Along the way, there were several milestones: Most points in a game by any Clipper team since moving to Los Angeles five-plus seasons ago. Forty-five assists, to equal the franchise record. Most field goals in a game (60) by an L.A. Clipper team. And a 10-5 home record and wins in six of their last seven games at the Sports Arena. That makes a 10-15 mark overall that much more respectable. That first quarter did it, as the Clippers opened with a 32-12 run to take an insurmountable lead. It seemed academic from there -- and the Clippers passed easily. A showing such as this should be worth extra credit. A first quarter unlike any the Clippers have played this season -- maybe any season -- began appropriately enough. Ken Norman's layup, Ron Harper's layup, Harper's layup, Norman's layup, Grant's layup and free throw, Charles Smith's dunk. It was an inside job all the way. The Clippers got an eight-foot jump hook from Joe Wolf, a 12-foot jump shot by Smith and a baseline 18-footer from Wolf, and that was the extent of their outside game in the first quarter. "We didn't have time to think about it," Grant said. "We just kept going." Why change a good thing? En route to taking an incredible 45-20 lead after 12 minutes, they hit an equally astonishing 19 of 27 attempts, or 70.3%. Neither could make the Clipper record book, but they were only getting warmed up. So was Don Nelson. The Golden State coach got his first technical 54 seconds into the second quarter, and Harper converted the free throw for a 46-22 advantage, soon to become 52-24. It was 62-47, not long after the Clippers built a 30-point lead, when Nelson had seen enough. Technical No. 2 came while arguing a no-foul call with 2:39 to play in the first half, getting him an early ejection, the coach's second in as many regular-season games at the Sports Arena. The smallest Clipper lead of the second quarter was 13, 60-47, and they had reason to feel good about it. This was a Golden State team, after all, that came in having won six of its last seven to rebound from a 4-14 start and had averaged 122.6 points in that recent stretch. All upbeat Warrior feelings disappeared quickly. After two quarters, they trailed, 70-55. The Clippers shot 60.4% in the first half, with Harper going seven of 10 for 19 points, Norman six of six for 12, and Grant four of six for 11 points and 10 assists. The final numbers were just as impressive. Grant had 20 assists, 15 points and six rebounds. Harper had a game-high 28 points, hitting 11 of 17 shots, and eight assists. Wolf, back in the starting lineup, had 12 rebounds and 10 points. Smith added 22. Seven players scored in double figures for the Clippers, who finished at 60% and had their first 100-shot game of 1989-90. About the only thing the Clippers didn't do well was shoot free throws, an ongoing problem, but this wasn't a night to worry about 69.2% from the line. It was about scoring 45 and 42 points in the first and third quarters, respectively. And about the continuation of Benoit Benjamin becoming a more integral part of the offense. Though not particularly impressive on the boards -- he has 43 rebounds in the last six games, including six in 23 minutes against the Warriors, and has broken double figures only once in that stretch -- Benjamin has received plenty of attention from the Clipper offense the last three games. Thursday, he responded by making seven of 10 shots for 19 points. "They (coaches) told me they want me to score more," he said. "So, I think I'll be seeing the ball more." When the Clipper offense works like this, everyone will. Clipper Notes Rod Thorn, the NBA's vice president for operations, reviewed the final seconds of Tuesday's 112-111 loss to Boston to check an apparent malfunction of the Sports Arena clock. Though not requested by either team, Thorn talked with the referees and looked at the tape and agreed that the scoreboard went from 0.2 to 0.0, but, after re-timing it himself Wednesday, Ron Harper's basket to win still came too late. A handful of arenas have had similar problems in the first season that tenths of a second are being used, but this was the first such occurrence at the Sports Arena. Thorn could not rule on the Clippers' main contention that the foul that led to the game-winning free throws by Larry Bird was incorrect because it was a judgment call. Representatives for the Clippers and Harper, a restricted free agent at the end of the season, met for two hours Wednesday in what was described as preliminary negotiations. The Clippers certainly plan to retain their star guard, who went into Thursday's game averaging 21.7 points, and agent Mark Termini said he also views the future here in a positive light. Harper was largely noncommittal. "The guys are playing hard, we're enjoying playing together and we're growing as a team," he said. "We'll just have to wait and see what takes place in the off-season." When told that some have said he could easily command $2 million a season, a hefty raise from his current $650,000 signed just out of college, Harper laughed. "They'd better go higher than that," he said. "I deserve 2 (million) with ease." Joe Wolf, who relinquished his role as starting center Dec. 9 after suffering a strained lower back, got the assignment back as Benoit Benjamin missed the afternoon shoot-around with a bad stomach and came off the bench. . . . The 33 points by Charles Smith in the Celtic game tied a career high. . . . His wrist and knee finally healed, Ken Norman is now bothered by a sore left groin strain, suffered Dec. 13 against Detroit. He was limping in the second quarter, left the game, and did not return.

Title: HE'S TEACHING THEM A LESSON; HOLIDAY BOWL: PENN STATE'S PATERNO TRIES TO DO IT ALL AND MANAGES TO WIN QUITE A FEW FOOTBALL GAMES IN THE PROCESS.
Author: BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: PATERNO, JOE; COLLEGE ATHLETICS; FOOTBALL; COACHES; PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY; HOLIDAY BOWL (FOOTBALL GAME)
Text: Joe Paterno's eyes squinted at the alarm clock next to his bed. It was 3:30 in the morning Wednesday. He thought briefly about getting up and going over some game plans, but while his mind was able and willing, his body told him to keep sleeping. He pulled the covers back up, and the next thing Paterno knew -- oh my gosh -- it was already 6. There was a game plan to prepare. Practice in three hours. Recruits to call. An ESPN interview later in the afternoon. And . . . oh, no, a Holiday Bowl luncheon aboard an aircraft carrier. That will take about three hours. Paterno, 63, walked across his hotel room, opened his drapes, looked toward the sky and, yes, there was some hope after all. The sky was gray, thick clouds hovering above, and maybe, just maybe, rain would soon follow. That's right. Joe Paterno brings his Penn State football team to California for the first time in 16 years, and what does he do? He prays for rain. "I've just got so much to do," Paterno said while preparing for tonight's game against Brigham Young. "It's a lot tougher on the West Coast with the time difference. By the time you get ahold of recruits back east, they're already having dinner or are out for the night." Paterno glances upward, begrudgingly concedes that it isn't going to rain, tosses his sport jacket in the back seat of his car and is ready to commence another day in the life of a college coach. Paterno has won more football games than any active coach with the exception of Bo Schembechler of Michigan. He has been voted coach of the year four times. He is the only football coach ever selected as Sports Illustrated's sportsman of the year. And he has led Penn State to two national championships, six undefeated seasons, 15 finishes in the top 10, a 31-game unbeaten streak and 19 bowl games. But he has got to learn that he can't control the weather, too. "Don't tell him that," said Bob Phillips, a Penn State assistant, "or he'll figure out a way to do that too." Yes, calling Joseph Vincent Paterno just a football coach is like saying Leonardo da Vinci was just a painter or Winston Churchill was just another politician. Certainly, you don't think a little ol' coach such as Paterno had an influence in the recent decision by Big Ten presidents to allow Penn State into their conference, do you? After all, wasn't Schembechler just moaning and groaning the other day about the fact that he and the other Big Ten athletic directors were left in the dark about this historical decision? "I'll talk to Bo after the Rose Bowl," said Paterno, his face breaking into an expansive grin. "I'll talk to him the day after. Of course, if he loses, I may wait a month." Paterno, who prefers being called an educator instead of having the title of coach in front of his name, is Penn State. This is a man who, in 1982, three weeks after winning the Sugar Bowl and the national championship, marched into a meeting with the university's board of trustees and scolded them. He urged the board to raise entrance requirements. He demanded that they hire superior and vibrant professors. He called for a fund-raising drive, in particular to raise more money for the school library. Not one mention was made of athletics or about enhancing the weight-training facilities. "Football is part of life," Paterno said, "not life itself." Paterno was selected co-chairman of the fund-raising campaign and has collected more than $310 million. A total of $330 million is expected by June. Of course, $150,000 of that can directly be attributed to Paterno. He donated $100,000 to the school library and $50,000 to the minority student fund. "I'm not sure if I should have done that now," Paterno said. "Now, my kids think I'm rich." Paterno laughed and said he certainly wouldn't be in this business if he ever wanted to be wealthy. The man behind the Photogray trifocals, with 20-20,000 eyesight, was supposed to be sitting in a three-piece suit with his Gucci shoes propped on his desk every day, not pacing the sidelines with a sweat shirt, white socks and a pair of sneakers. He indeed was bred to be more than a coach. His aunt was in charge of foreign languages for a Long Island school district; his cousin became president of Chrysler, and his father went to night school until he was 40 to obtain his law degree. When Paterno accepted Rip Engle's offer in 1950 to be an assistant coach at Penn State, he promised his father he did it only to earn extra money for law school. It has been 39 years now, and Paterno has yet to take his first law class. Yeah, he's a coach all right: His 219-57-3 record certainly verifies that. But how many coaches do you know who draw up game plans while listening to the opera, write opinion pieces for the New York Times or quote Browning? How many coaches do you know who give their players permission to skip practice to study for a big test, install a two-hour mandatory study hall every night during a player's freshman year and have a wife tutoring English and a son tutoring math to the players? How many coaches do you know whose phone numbers are listed in the phone book, receive ovations when they simply rise to go to the bathroom during basketball games and have been the subject of look-alike contests -- "I don't know why anyone would want to win," he says -- the past three homecomings? How many coaches do you know who drive a Ford Escort around town, live in the same house they've owned the past 22 years and once turned down a four-year contract worth $1.4 million from the New England Patriots to stay at a $35,000-a-year job? "You know, every once in a while I'll see the Super Bowl, and I'll think how nice it would be to be involved in that," Paterno said. "But that passes in a hurry. "My wife and I, we're not money people. I wouldn't know what to do with it. People say, 'Why don't you get a BMW or something to drive in.' Me? I'd be too nervous driving one of those jobs. They say, 'OK, how about buying your wife a fur coat.' Hey, she doesn't want one. "Believe me, we're perfectly comfortable with the way things are." Paterno, who's riding shotgun on the way to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium so he can talk about life at State College, Pa., never, of course, will be satisfied with himself. Since the day he arrived at Penn State, he has been a brooder, a fanatic about details and a hopeless notemaker. He goes to bed at 11:30. He's usually up at 5 a.m., but often feels guilty that he's sleeping too much and awakens at 3. Teams might beat Paterno with their talent. There are times he'll even be outcoached. But never does Paterno want it said that he was beaten because of forgotten details. "I just hate to lose," he said, "God, I hate to lose. I know I preach a lot about being willing to lose, that there can be valor in losing to a better opponent, but I have never learned how not to hate losing." Winning is such an obsession to Paterno that his first thought on most mornings is the games Penn State has lost and what he could have done differently. It took him 10 months to get over the 1979 Sugar Bowl defeat, which cost Penn State the national championship. And he has been miffed for 20 years now that President Richard Nixon had the gall to declare Texas the national champion in 1969 when Penn State was undefeated. Four years later, at Penn State's commencement ceremonies, Paterno said, "If President Nixon knew so little about Watergate, how could he know so much about football?" Of course, Paterno had himself partially to blame, too. He voted for Nixon in 1968. He didn't say who got his vote in 1972. The telephone rang in Paterno's room. It was Jack White, a former quarterback who played under Paterno in 1965 and 1966. They chatted for a while, and Paterno learned that Jack is a dentist in San Diego. They talked a little more and, while discussing their families, White mentioned that he has a son who played high school football and will graduate this May. He is Dan White of Point Loma, and he just so happens to have been the top-rated quarterback in San Diego County, passing for 3,169 yards this past season. He also happened to be The Times' back of the year. So, Paterno slammed down the telephone and drove straight to White's house ready with a recruiting pitch, right? Well, not exactly. Oh, Paterno said he probably will talk with White while he's in town. But to recruit him? Doubtful. "I just don't think it's right," Paterno said. "I'm just not sure a kid should come that far away from home unless there are very special circumstances, like he has family back east or we have some courses that aren't available elsewhere. "I'd feel awful to have a kid come so far and be homesick." This is why if you look at your program tonight, you'll notice there are no California kids on the roster. In fact, there are only two from west of the Mississippi. Penn State, adorned with its black shoes, nameless uniforms and plain helmets, simply is not for everyone. The campus is located two hours away from the nearest major airport in Harrisburg and it's about a three-hour drive to either Philadelphia or Pittsburgh. "I think it takes a special kid to come to Penn State," Phillips said, "and Joe knows this. He has a special knack of knowing what kids will fit in and what ones won't. Very seldom is he ever wrong on a kid." It's a great attribute, naturally, when a coach can project the ability of a high school player in college, but it's much more difficult than that for Paterno. Playing football is not enough. He wants a diploma to go along with it. "I don't think any of us are smarter than any other team's players," said junior fullback Leroy Thompson, "but I think we work harder. Coach Paterno makes sure we're going to those classes. If we have a big test coming up or something, he'll even give us a day off or two. "I came close to going to Miami. Out of high school, that's where I thought I'd go. Once I saw the ocean, I just fell in love with the place. "But during my visit, it was strange. They never talked about academics the whole time I was there, just football. "Now, when Coach Paterno came to see me, he didn't even talk about football. In fact, he hardly even talked to me. I just sat back while he talked with my parents, brother and sister. He said, 'I'll talk to you later.' "I came back, and they were all playing cards together. I guess I knew then where I was going." There's actually one player on the Penn State roster, one Paterno didn't want to embarrass by identifying, who had to do book reports before Paterno gave him a scholarship. "He came from a tough inner-city school," Paterno said. "He had the grades in high school, but the English fundamentals were not there. I wanted him to start reading." So, every two weeks, the player would read a book, write a book report and mail it to Paterno's wife, Sue. Once he got to college, Sue continued working with him in English while David, Paterno's son, tutored him in math. "A lot of these kids have good minds, they just don't use them," Paterno said. "Colleges are starting to make a big deal out of the graduation rate, but that can be overblown, too. What good is a college education if you can't write a letter or discuss politics?" This is why when someone asks Paterno which team was the best he ever coached, the response will always be the same: "That will be determined by what those players contributed to society." It's also why Paterno remains humble in discussing his coaching feats. He acknowledges that he's not the same coach he was 20 years ago, when he called every offensive and defensive play. But he says he's much improved from a year ago, when he says he allowed outside activities to detract from his time from the football field. "I actually did more harm than good, just being around," Paterno said. "My staff would have meetings and decide on something, and I'd put my two cents in and throw everything out of whack. "I deserved the kind of season we had." How foolish, he now says, he was for leaving the first week of practice to attend the Republican National Convention in New Orleans, where he seconded the nomination of George Bush. How silly he was to devote most of his week to being the driving force behind the college's campaign fund. How wrong he was to delegate all of the authority to his assistants and expect success on the field. He was awakened with a cold slap in the face when the Penn State season ended in 1988. For the first time in 50 years, Penn State finished with a losing record -- 5-6. Paterno thought a while about quitting, thinking perhaps he might have outlived his usefulness. Then he realized that he'd be quitting the program he so long has loved and decided that there's no way he's going to leave Penn State in any condition that's less than ideal. So he went back to the midnight film sessions. He put his his 165-pound body on that blocking sled. And he stuck that whistle back in his mouth. Penn State lost its season-opener to Virginia, 14-6, but lost just two more games the rest of the season, finishing 7-3-1. It was not a vintage Penn State season by any means, but, as Paterno will tell you, it's the beginning of a new era. He has told his freshman players that he'll remain with them throughout their collegiate eligibility and, although he cannot make any promises, he'll let them know that since he took over at Penn State, every player completing his eligibility has: -- Played on a team that won the national championship. -- Played on a team that had an undefeated season. -- Played in a bowl game for the national championship. "It'd be nice to go out with another national championship," Paterno said, "but I'm not even thinking of that scenario. If I don't win another national championship, it doesn't mean I'm not a success. It doesn't mean a thing. I've enjoyed it, and I'm going to keep enjoying it. "Nothing is going to change that, as long as I can help it."

Title: GOING TO DEFENSE OF RAMS' PREVENT; NFL PLAYOFFS: BEND-BUT-DON'T-BREAK DRIVES FANS CRAZY, BUT ROBINSON DOESN'T HAVE THE PERSONNEL FOR ANYTHING ELSE.
Author: CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: LOS ANGELES RAMS (FOOTBALL TEAM); RYAN, BUDDY; PHILADELPHIA EAGLES (FOOTBALL TEAM); SHURMUR, FRITZ; ROBINSON, JOHN; COACHES
Text: "Prevent defense" may have become the quiche of our time. Real men don't play it. Philadelphia Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan wouldn't be caught dead in a zone. "I only use it with two plays left in the game," Ryan said this week. "I've never been much of a prevent guy. Prevent defense prevents you from winning." That said, there is one defensive unit that still dabbles in it occasionally on weekends -- Ryan's opponent this Sunday, as a matter of fact. You may have caught their act last Sunday in New England, sewing up the last wild-card playoff spot. Piece of cake, really. The Rams, protecting a four-point lead, dropped into their zone, called off the pass rush, dished out yards like peanuts, then stopped the Patriots three times inside their five-yard line, the last stand coming as the clock, the regular season and a few Ram loyalists expired in unison. No one ever said prevent defense was easy to stomach, the axiom being: Thou shalt surrender everything but game-winning touchdowns. "I don't give a . . . what Buddy Ryan says," Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said in defense of his strategies. "It caused us to win last week. The bottom line is this: Do you in fact win or lose the game? Obviously, if it works out that you lose the game, then it's the wrong choice. But if you're going to say because they got 95 yards on you, it was wrong, that's bull. They didn't get the last four." If Shurmur seems a bit testy, it's only because he is a bit testy. He has taken enough shots about his defense in recent weeks to warrant a bulletproof vest. The Rams enter Sunday's playoff game in Philadelphia with the league's 21st-ranked defense, 28th -- and last -- against the pass. "Before, we had great defenses and we never won," cornerback LeRoy Irvin theorized. "So, maybe since we have such a lousy defense, maybe we'll pull it out." The defense wasn't lousy by design, of course. The Rams planned a more aggressive style this year until a half dozen or so key players started checking in for surgery. Coach John Robinson commends Ryan's attacking style, wishing he had the beef-eating front four -- Reggie White, Jerome Brown, Clyde Simmons and Mike Pitts -- that Ryan has to rush the quarterback on every down. Who wouldn't hate prevent defense? "I'm sure he hates it," Robinson said of Ryan. "He's got four guys that can come in and get you." By contrast, because of serious injuries to the defensive front, the Rams may introduce the league's first all-linebacker pass-rush this weekend. Meet the Leansome Foursome -- Kevin Greene, Brett Faryniarz, Fred Strickland and George Bethune. Against New England, Bethune learned to play defensive end in 25 quick steps, all leading to the huddle. Coach Marv Goux basically diagramed a three-point stance in the dirt for Bethune and shoved the rookie onto the field for the Patriots' final drive. "And people are screaming, 'Why didn't you blitz?' " Shurmur said. "We were playing a guy at left defensive end the whole series who had never had lined up a down in practice, George Bethune. And if I called a blitz, and he took the wrong gap, and they got more time to throw the ball, now how smart was that?" The Ram defense had been reduced to this: "George," Shurmur told Bethune, "we've got no other defensive left ends. You've got to put your hand on the ground and line up outside the guy." Shurmur added: "You've got to throw all those factors in 25 seconds and make a call." Robinson thinks that prevent defense gets a bad rap. "I think the god of prevent defense is not getting a fair shake up there," he said. Yet, the Rams wouldn't be taking such preventive tacts had the first-team defense shown up this season. Instead, they've had to work around some sizable roadblocks: -- Larry Kelm and Strickland. Out of the lineup because of assorted injuries, the Rams' projected starters as inside linebackers didn't start a game together until Week 10. -- On Nov. 19, starting left end Doug Reed twisted an ankle against Phoenix. He was supposed to be out two weeks until a crack was found in the ankle, whereupon Reed was shipped to injured reserved. Update: Reed still walks with a limp and would be eligible to return only if the Rams advance to the Super Bowl. -- On Nov. 26, cornerback Cliff Hicks strained his right knee against New Orleans. He missed the next game against Dallas, then played sparingly in the final three games. Update: Hicks underwent reconstructive knee surgery Wednesday. -- On Dec. 3, starting right end Mike Piel dislocated his left elbow against Dallas. Update: He's going to try to return this week, playing with a brace. -- On Dec. 11, first-round draft pick Bill Hawkins, finally playing well after a rough start, suffered left knee-ligament damage against San Francisco. Update: Hawkins underwent arthroscopic surgery and could return only if the Rams went on world tour in March, Robinson quips. -- On Dec. 17, safety Anthony Newman broke his left elbow in the team's rout of the New York Jets. In the locker room afterward, Newman vowed to return quickly. Update: Newman was placed on injured reserve Dec. 21. As stop-gap measures, the Rams recently signed Sean Smith, a former Chicago Bear defensive end who had been unemployed, and recalled rookie linebacker Brian Smith from injured reserve, moving him to defensive end. Linebacker Mark Messner, released from the developmental squad at one point this year, was also recalled and placed on active duty. In fact, the two Smiths and Messner formed the Rams' defensive front during one series against New England. Shurmur said: "There were a hell of a lot of weeks here when they weren't on the roster, or even in this town. Our best accomplishment was coaching George Bethune into getting ready in 25 seconds, between plays on the sideline. It was a great clinic." Still, this week the opposing coach was indirectly taking swipes at the Rams' manhood, saying that prevent defense prevents you from winning. "I feel pretty good," Shurmur countered. "We've won six out of seven. A lot of guys can sit here until 5 in the morning and come up with grand schemes, but what we get paid for is what happens on Sunday. That's what the game is all about. It's sure not about statistics." And this, Buddy, is for you: Shurmur says zone defense is far more difficult to teach than man-to-man. "The easiest way to play defense is to have four guys up front that will come and completely dominate the line of scrimmage," Shurmur said, "where there's no pressure on the cover guys and no pressure on your calls. Where the pressure comes on your calls is when the ball goes down the field, and they're going to make the play or you're going to make the play." The challenge this week is containing Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham, the most elusive open-field runner since Manuel Noriega. An impossible task for the porous Rams? Maybe not. Shurmur guesses that a controlled zone defense might be the best way to keep Cunningham in check. It just so happens, that's what the Rams play. Or haven't you noticed? "I'm not sure patience isn't a pretty good attribute," Shurmur said. "And if you don't have any, you'd better not be messing around with zone defense." Mess around -- the Rams? Ram Notes More bad news for the Ram defense, and not just for this weekend. Third-year cornerback Clifford Hicks underwent surgery Wednesday to repair anterior cruciate damage in his right knee. It was a major reconstructive operation, and Hicks is expected to be out at least eight months. Hicks injured the knee against New Orleans on Nov. 26 but returned to play sparingly in the team's last three games. "Obviously, he's gone for a long period of time," Coach John Robinson said. "Whether he's back next year, I don't know." Robinson added that Hicks' future in the league will probably be at safety, a position that requires less speed than cornerback. Hicks won the starting right corner position over LeRoy Irvin before his injury against the Saints. Hicks started six games in all, making 22 tackles and two interceptions.

Text: TODAY'S GAMES NONCONFERENCE EAST TENNESSEE STATE (8-2) at UCLA (7-1), 7:30 p.m. TV -- Prime Ticket, 10:30 p.m. (delayed). RADIO -- KMPC (710). This is the first meeting between the schools. UCLA, which has won three in a row since losing to Notre Dame Dec. 17, shot a season-high 54.2% in Wednesday night's 74-65 victory over Fresno State. Forward Don MacLean led the Bruins with 25 points and nine rebounds. With Kevin Walker still struggling -- he made one free throw and grabbed one rebound in 10 minutes Wednesday night -- Tracy Murray has been playing more and responding well. The 6-foot-8 freshman had 18 points and five rebounds against Fresno State, and in the last three games has averaged 26 minutes, 16.3 points and five rebounds. East Tennessee State played in the Chaminade tournament in Hawaii, where the Buccaneers beat East Carolina and Chaminade but lost to Maryland. All five starters are back from last season's squad. The biggest victory for the Buccaneers this season was over North Carolina State, 92-82, at Raleigh, N.C. FAR WEST TOURNAMENT at Portland, Ore. PEPPERDINE (4-4) vs. BOSTON UNIVERSITY (2-6), 1 p.m. TV -- None. Radio -- KWNK (670). In the first round, Louisiana Tech rallied in the second half to beat Pepperdine, 76-73. Dexter Howard led the Waves with 17 points, while Shann Ferch and Craig Davis scored 16 and 13, respectively. Tom Lewis, recovering from a dislocated little finger on his right hand, had just three points. Oregon State routed Boston University, 86-66, in another first-round game. Steven Key, who had been averaging 17 points a game for the Terriers, was held to seven points. The Terriers had 27 turnovers against the Beavers. COWBOY SHOOTOUT at Casper, Wyo. CS FULLERTON (5-2) vs. MIDDLE TENNESSEE ST. (4-3), 6 p.m., PST. TV -- None. Radio -- KMNY (1600). After a 5-0 start, Fullerton has lost its last two games, falling to Colorado State by 29 points and to UCLA by 12 in the first of six road games in a row. Fullerton had an eventful practice Thursday. Cedric Ceballos, whose 23.4-point average leads the team, required five sutures after taking an elbow above his left eye, but Coach John Sneed expects him to start. Center John Sykes, whose eye has been irritated by an allergic reaction, practiced but is expected to be replaced in the starting lineup by freshman Aaron Wilhite. And Sneed said that junior reserve forward Ron Caldwell will not play after exchanges in practice in which Sneed repeatedly called Caldwell "a loser" and Caldwell responded by balking at running sprints and sitting out part of practice. Middle Tennessee State has two starters back from a team that went 23-8 and upset Florida State in the NCAA tournament.

Title: MINER'S 37 LEAD USC WIN; TROJANS: HE JUST MISSES FRESHMAN RECORD IN 92-68 VICTORY OVER CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE.
Author: CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: Freshman guard Harold Miner of USC had an extraordinary reputation at Inglewood High School, where he was called Baby Jordan after averaging 29.5 points, 10.5 rebounds and four assists per game. But the only similarities between Michael Jordan and Miner are that both players stick out their tongues when they shoot, both wear No. 23 and both have their closely cropped hair. "I guess I (stick out my tongue) because I watch him so much," Miner said. "It's second nature." Needless to say, nobody is going to name a basketball shoe after Miner based on his performances at USC, where he has averaged 12.5 points in his first six games. Thursday, however, he was nearly as prolific as Jordan, scoring 37 points in the Trojans' 92-68 victory over Central Connecticut State at the Sports Arena. Miner scored 20 points in the first half and 17 in the second. He hit 15 of 22 shots, including a three-pointer, and made all six of his free throws. Miner had a chance to break USC's single-game freshman scoring record of 39 points, set by Cliff Robinson against California in 1978. After he made a four-foot jumper with 4:51 left, Miner knew the record was within reach. The Trojans fed him on their next possession, but he forced a shot against three defenders. After missing, Miner left the game with 2:32 remaining. "I wasn't sure I was close to the record, but I had a feeling because they were passing me the ball," Miner said. "I was trying not to think about it because that's not the way I like to play. "I was not concerned with the record. I just wanted to get into the flow and help our team win." Miner's most creative shot was an explosive second-half dunk that brought an ovation from the announced crowd of 1,127. "I got all my frustrations out on the dunk," Miner said. "Basically, I'm a perfectionist, and there were some things I wasn't doing right today." What did he do wrong? "Sometimes I would miss assignments on defense and sometimes I would miss assignments on the full-court press," said Miner, a 6-5, 185-pound All-Southern Section selection last season. But Miner said he tries to please himself and no one else. "I'm just trying to play within myself and live up to my own expectations, not the expectations of everyone else, because it's virtually impossible to do that," Miner said. Has Miner developed more slowly than expected? "Most of the really outstanding players I've coached had lackluster freshman years," USC Coach George Raveling said. "I can't think of anybody I've ever coached who came in as a freshman and was just a dominant player. He's making the same progress as a freshman as when I had Don Collins at Washington State and Roy Marble at Iowa." After scoring 25 points in his first collegiate game, Miner struggled, scoring only 18 in his next three games. But Miner has broken out of his slump, scoring 69 points in his last three. "He continues to show the tremendous potential that he has," Raveling said. "Obviously, it would be a lot more meaningful if it were against UCLA or Arizona." The Trojans (4-3) had little trouble disposing of Central Connecticut (1-7), putting together a 22-5 spurt in the final 8:13 of the half to take a 48-23 lead. USC led by as many as 31 points in the second half. Trojan Notes Although the Sports Arena was as deserted as a Christmas tree lot on Dec. 26, the crowd was boosted when the USC band arrived after practicing for Monday's Rose Parade and Rose Bowl game. "When the band came in, it gave the place a sellout atmosphere," Trojan Coach George Raveling said. . . . Chris Munk blocked two shots to move into third place on USC's all-time list. . . . The Trojans play Northern Arizona Saturday at 2 p.m. at the Sports Arena.

Title: HOFSTRA NO MATCH FOR LONG BEACH
Author: DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: Cal State Long Beach found the shooting touch it had lost earlier in the week in Las Vegas and defeated Hofstra University, 89-69, in a nonconference game before 1,920 fans in the 49er gym Thursday night. Long Beach shot 54.7% from the field in the easy victory, a big improvement over the 27.5% the 49ers shot Tuesday night in a 78-58 loss to Nevada Las Vegas. Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington had said that no team he had ever coached had shot worse than the 49ers did in that game. But against Hofstra, the 49ers, who improved their overall record to 7-2, made nine of their first 12 shots, including four jump shots beyond 15 feet. They had made only two outside shots at Las Vegas. "It's easier to shoot in your own gym," Harrington said. "I was pleased we came back so aggressively after losing Tuesday night." The 49ers were led in scoring by guards Lucious Harris and Bobby Sears, each of whom scored 14 points. Sears started in place of Tyrone Mitchell because Mitchell had been late to practice Wednesday. Before six minutes were gone in the game, Long Beach was ahead, 19-5. "I heard Long Beach wasn't a good shooting team, but in the first half you could have fooled me," said Hofstra Coach Butch van Breda Kolff, who coached the Lakers in the late 1960s. Hofstra, of Hempstead, N.Y., fell to 3-6. Asked how Long Beach compared with St. John's, to whom Hofstra lost by 11 points earlier in the season, van Breda Kolff said, "If they played here, St. John's would be in trouble." The 49ers are 4-0 at home. Long Beach led, 40-18, at halftime, and increased the advantage to 55-24 with about 15 minutes left.

Abstract: null
Text: Matt Othick scored 17 points and No. 21 Arizona held Penn State to 30% shooting and beat the Nittany Lions, 74-55, Thursday night and advance to the final of the Arizona tournament at Tucson. Arizona (4-2) limited Penn State to 18 field goals in 60 attempts, breaking a tournament record set earlier in the evening by Purdue, which beat Wake Forest in the opener. The victory was the Wildcats' 36th in a row at home. They will meet the Boilermakers in the championship game on Saturday. Ed Fogell scored 14 points for the Nittany Lions. Oregon 77, Northeastern 74 -- Keith Reynolds scored 23 points, nine in the closing four minutes, and Terrell Brandon added 18 as the Ducks won a first-round game in the Far West tournament at Portland, Ore. Reynolds scored 15 points in the second half and made 11 of 11 from the free-throw line. Freshman guard Lamont Hough had 15 points and Steve Carney 14 for the Huskies (2-5). Oregon is 6-3. No. 1 Syracuse 85, Lafayette 64 -- Billy Owens had 15 of his 17 points in the first half as the Orangemen pulled away from the Leopards at Syracuse, N.Y., for their 15th consecutive home-court victory. Syracuse, which also got 17 points from Stephen Thompson, improved to 9-0 while matching its longest winning streak in the Carrier Dome. The last home-court loss for Syracuse was against Pittsburgh on Jan. 4, 1989. Syracuse also won 15 in a row at home during the 1984-85 and 1985-86 seasons. Lafayette (5-3) got 15 points from center Richard Soto. No. 5 Michigan 102, Northern Michigan 74 -- Terry Mills scored 14 of his 18 points in the second half as the Wolverines won easily at Ann Arbor, Mich.

Florida (4-3) had cut a 13-point deficit to 70-67 with 1:12 left in the game. But Doug Overton dribbled away 40 seconds for La Salle (7-0), and passed to Simmons, who hit an eight-foot jumper with 28 seconds left in the game. Dwayne Davis had 19 points for Florida. Arizona State 92, Manhattan 70 -- Matt Anderson scored 14 of his 21 points in a lopsided first half as the Sun Devils won a first-round game in the Arizona State tournament in Tempe, Ariz. The Sun Devils (5-4) will play in tonight's championship game against Georgia (7-1), which beat Wisconsin, 65-64, in the other first-round game. Keith Bullock had 14 points for Manhattan (4-4). Utah State 79, Utah 77 -- Kendall Youngblood scored a career-high 27 points and Randy Funk scored 11 to lead the Aggies at Logan.

Title: MCMURTRY IS MICHIGAN'S BO JACKSON; ROSE BOWL: RECEIVER PLAYS TWO SPORTS, ALTHOUGH BASEBALL HAS TAKEN A BACK SEAT TO FOOTBALL.
Author: MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: FOOTBALL PLAYERS; BASEBALL PLAYERS; COLLEGE ATHLETICS; UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN; MCMURTRY, GREG
Text: It would be understandable if Michigan's Greg McMurtry were second-guessing a decision that he made coming out of high school in Brockton, Mass. As a celebrated two-sport star, he turned down a $172,000 signing bonus with the Boston Red Sox to pursue a career in college football. This season, as a senior wide receiver for Michigan, he has prospered on a team that is mainly run-oriented. His college baseball accomplishments have been mediocre considering that he was a major league prospect. Yet the 6-foot-3, 206-pounder seemingly has no regrets. "I wanted to play college football to see how good I could be," he said. "That's the main reason why I turned down an offer to play baseball." Asked if had any second thoughts, McMurtry said: "No, not all." In three baseball seasons, McMurtry had a batting average of .258 with 10 home runs and 83 runs batted in. The big money that was once offered may not be forthcoming now, although he said some major league teams are still interested in him. He said he still hasn't decided about his future -- the NFL or pro baseball. As for his college baseball experience, he said: "It's kind of disappointing, but I knew coming in that I wouldn't be able to put in as much time as I wanted to. In the past four years, I've come to realize why I haven't been as good a player as I am capable of being." Dividing time between baseball and football practice in the spring has not been conducive to his development as a baseball player. However, he has excelled in football. Michigan is not a throwback to the Big Ten teams that used to visit the Rose Bowl. You know, three yards and a cloud of dust for a running game, with passing as a last alternative. Nonetheless, the Wolverines aren't exactly an aerial circus. For example, quarterbacks Michael Taylor and Elvis Grbac have thrown 218 passes over the course of an 11-game season, compared to 321 attempts by USC's Todd Marinovich. McMurtry has made the most of his somewhat limited opportunities as a receiver. He has caught 37 passes this season for 655 yards and seven touchdowns. Moreover, in a Nov. 18 game against Minnesota, he caught three touchdown passes from Taylor, all in one quarter, tying a school record set by All-American Ron Kramer in 1955. He is a big-play receiver who doesn't get as many opportunities to display his skills as other athletes in pass-minded offenses. Yet, McMurtry puts such comparisons in perspective. "I could have gone to Purdue and caught 50 or 60 passes a year and we'd lose eight games and be physically beat every week. Who wants to do that? I can come here and catch 30 or 40, go to the Rose Bowl and have a good time beating on people instead of people beating on us." Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler was so intent on recruiting McMurtry that he offered him jersey No. 1 if he chose the school. That numeral was previously worn by Schembechler's favorite player, Anthony Carter, an accomplished receiver with the Minnesota Vikings. Carter is Michigan's all-time leading receiver in receptions, yardage and touchdowns. That alone shows the esteem in which Schembechler held McMurtry -- and still does. "He's the salt of the earth, a wonderful kid," Schembechler said. "He does everything you could ask of a receiver and you never hear a word out of him. To be honest, I don't know why you don't see his name more in headlines. We think he's a great player." Bo, of course, knows that numbers get headlines. UCLA was among the schools that tried to recruit McMurtry for football. It can be fantasized now that he could have spent part of his collegiate career catching passes from Troy Aikman, who went on to become No. 1 draft choice of the Dallas Cowboys. McMurtry just smiled quietly when asked if he had been interested in playing for UCLA. "Oh yeah, I considered UCLA. At the time, though, it was too far away," he said. So McMurtry lives with his decision, but at times his thoughts wander. "Sometimes I fantasize about what it would be like playing for the Red Sox, but I have no regrets," he told the Detroit News. "It would have been nice, but I decided to try football and get an education. Football has always been number one with me, so if I had to do it all over again, I'd do the same thing." No. 1 will have special significance in Monday's Rose Bowl game. USC split end John Jackson, the school's all-time leading receiver, also has that number. Jackson has caught more passes this season than McMurtry, 57 to 37, but the Michigan split end has more touchdowns, seven to five. It should be quite a matchup.

Title: ROSE BOWL NOTEBOOK; RUMORS OF NFL SALARY CAP CREATE PROBLEMS
Author: STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: FOOTBALL PLAYERS -- WAGES AND SALARIES; COLLEGE ATHLETICS; UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; CARRIER, MARK; SEAU, JUNIOR; ATHLETIC RECRUITING
Text: In the weeks leading up to Monday's Rose Bowl game, reporters have approached Trojans Mark Carrier and Junior Seau to talk, ostensibly, about the game, injuries or strategy. It has been somewhat of a diversionary tactic. Sooner or later, the reporters manage to steer the conversation around to The Question: Will the pair, having enjoyed excellent, high-profile seasons, turn their backs on their final season of eligibility and opt for the NFL draft? Carrier seems to have shut the door on that option. Seau has hung a sign on the door that reads: See me after the Rose Bowl. Their coach, Larry Smith, is not so evasive. He has a few questions of his own and he wants them answered now, but not by Seau, the linebacker named Pacific 10 defensive player of the year, nor by Carrier, an All-American defensive back. Smith's target is the NFL. His biggest concern is the rumor of a salary cap that could be instituted by the league next year. Since it would limit the amount first-year players could be offered, there is added pressure on players such as Carrier and Seau to sign now. "That is a real festering problem," Smith said, "this talk of a salary cap. Nobody has really come out and said it's going to be or it's not going to be. I had a pro scout tell me as many as 50 juniors were going to think about turning pro if they put in a salary cap. Then, you've got agents out here who are telling everything in the book to try to get guys to change. "If you have 40 to 50 juniors come out this year, there'll be 10 or 15 sophomores next year. I think the NFL has got to do something. If they want to continue their relationship with college football, they had better get their heads out of the sand and take a stand. They have dumped it in our lap, and I don't think that's fair. We have cooperated with them in every way possible. We basically have been a farm system for them. "There have to be some guidelines set. I would much rather have (the NFL) say, OK, juniors can be drafted. Just like they do in baseball. If they can sign them, then they sign them. If they can't, then (the juniors) come back and play their last year, finish their degree and all that kind of stuff. That way, there would be something set." At best, that's not in the immediate future. The careers of Carrier and Seau are. So where does Smith think they stand? "We haven't tried to make a decision," Smith said. "When the bowl is over, we (he and Carrier and Seau) will try to get the facts and do what's best for the players. I don't know if the NFL can give us the facts or if they even know." According to Carrier, it doesn't matter. "I'm just learning about the NFL," he said. "I haven't talked to any agents or picked one. My decision is, I will be back in school. There's not enough job security for me (in the NFL). By getting my degree, at least, I'll know that is something they can't take away from me in case of bodily injury." Carrier, however, wouldn't totally shut the door. "If there's a re-evaluation," he said, meaning perhaps the prospect of becoming a high first-round pick, "I would sit down and talk it over with my family." Seau said: "I'm a USC Trojan come Jan. 1, and we'll see from there on, but I'm leaning on coming back to school. They can say all they want, but they don't know the truth. The truth is, once you put your name in the draft, whoever gets you will give you as much as they want to give you. I want to have more control on that than I do this year, more of a background and a base as a player, a person and a mature young man coming out. "A big factor for me to stay is to help lead our team. That's why I came to USC, to lead. I feel I have leadership qualities to help some of the people who have helped me." But among those people who have helped him is his father, Tiaina, who has a heart problem. And there's the matter of four brothers and two sisters. A big contract would be significant for the family. "I could wait," Seau said. "My father could wait. Everyone is throwing everything at us at once and it's looking good, but I know it's just a picture for now." A picture that remains fuzzy at best. USC will put its first-string defense on the field Monday for the first time this season. Don Gibson, No. 1 on the depth chart at nose guard, tore knee ligaments during practice in August and didn't play a down all season. He has continued his rehabilitation program, is practicing and is expected to play against Michigan. Times staff writer Mal Florence contributed to this story.

Text: The University of Florida football season, pitted with trouble almost from the opening kickoff, will pause for a break in the action. The Gators will play Washington in the Freedom Bowl at 11 a.m. Saturday at Anaheim Stadium. It will be a brief respite to actually play football, then it's back to the controversy, alleged illegalities and turmoil that have marred the Gators' 1989 season. The problems began with a season-opening upset loss to Mississippi and have yet to subside, and may not for months to come. There are charges of assault, drug use, fraud, gambling and illegal payoffs facing Florida athletes and coaches. The Gators' rap sheet extends far and wide. With Florida's 7-4 record, including three losses in the last four games, some would think the Gators are lucky to be playing in a bowl game. Then again, with the Gators' record off the field this season, some might think they're lucky to be playing, period. Charges that Coach Galen Hall made illegal payments to assistant coaches from 1986 to 1988 and to a player in 1987 -- both violations of National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules -- forced him to resign Oct. 8. On Oct. 16, quarterback Kyle Morris and three other Gator football players were suspended for betting on professional and college football games. The four did not bet on Florida games or on games involving Southeastern Conference teams. The NCAA has yet to rule on the case and a decision to file criminal charges has yet to be announced by Florida State Attorney Len Register. Morris, a sophomore, reportedly has worked out an agreement with the school that would allow him to be reinstated with his scholarship restored, sometime after the Freedom Bowl. The NCAA would have to approve such a move, however. And that's only a portion of the dark cloud that hangs over Florida's football team. On Nov. 20, Tony McCoy, a junior defensive tackle, was arrested in connection with a sexual assault charge on a 22-year-old female student. McCoy, who was charged with one count of sexual battery and one count of aggravated battery, has not returned to the team. Earlier this month, it was disclosed that Hall and Florida basketball Coach Norm Sloan used a little-known expense account to ring up $41,000 in purchases of golf sweaters and pistachio nuts, among other things. And last year, a federal grand jury in Tallahassee, Fla., linked former Gator football and basketball players to drug use in the Gainesville area. Some of the players told the grand jury they received money from Sloan and assistant Monte Towe. Sloan, Towe and two other assistants resigned Oct. 31 in the wake of mail fraud and perjury charges. That investigation led to indictments of four sports agents on charges of defrauding the university by making payments to football and basketball players with eligibility remaining. The four pleaded guilty to lesser charges. After Hall resigned, defensive coordinator Gary Darnell was named interim coach and almost immediately Gator boosters began to clamor for Steve Spurrier, a former Heisman Trophy winner at Florida and current Duke coach. There have been reports this week that Spurrier, whose Duke team played Texas Tech in the All-American Bowl Thursday night, will be named coach as early as today. "I was assured that if any changes were made, I'd be the first one to know and that's all I ask," Darnell said. At least one player, cornerback Richard Fain, would like to see Darnell hired. "I felt he did a terrific job," Fain said. "He's a motivator. He doesn't pull any punches. I'd enjoy having him as the head coach." This season has left an indelible mark in and around Gainesville. The battle lines are clearly drawn. Charles Reed, the chancellor of the state's university system, called for, among other things, a ban on spring football, freshman eligibility and athletic dorms at Florida's nine public universities. On Nov. 29, Stephen C. O'Connell, President Emeritus of the University of Florida, wrote in a guest column in the Gainesville Sun, "So where is the scandal here? "The university and its athletic programs ought to be judged not by the fact these incidents occurred, but by what it has done about them." The university conducted an 18-month investigation into Hall's payments and recently concluded a lengthy investigation of Morris' alleged gambling. Both reports were made available to the NCAA. Nevertheless, Gator followers are nervously awaiting the NCAA's ruling. If a school is found guilty of major violations twice within a five-year span, the NCAA can impose the death penalty for one or two years. So far, Southern Methodist's football team is the only program to receive that punishment. In 1984, Charley Pell resigned amid allegations of recruiting violations. The NCAA found 107 violations and placed the Gators on three years probation, making Florida eligible for the death penalty. That's one reason Saturday's game means so much to Florida. For three hours, give or take a TV timeout or two, Team Turmoil will have a chance to play football. "Nobody on this team had anything to do with it, yet we are somewhat the victims of this ordeal," linebacker Jerry Odom told reporters in Gainesville two days after Hall resigned. Indeed, Odom, a junior who is second on the team in tackles, and his Gator teammates have had to pick up the pieces from a season gone wrong. In a strange way, the troubled times have brought the Gators together. "The way we responded is probably one of the reasons we're going to this bowl game," said All-American running back Emmitt Smith. "We battled back through adversity and responded in a positive way. It didn't affect me. I try to put everything in perspective. I'm trying to put the bad stuff behind and the stuff that's good for the team in front." Still, Florida's season has been one of curious twists, turns, ups and downs. And that's just the Gators' play on the field. After a 24-19 loss to Mississippi, the Gators won four in a row, capped by a 16-13 victory over Louisiana State. "Family. Family," fullback Cedric Smith screamed in the locker room after Arden Czyzewski's 41-yard field goal with no time remaining beat LSU. The Gators gave Hall the game ball, perhaps knowing it would be his last. Hall resigned the next day, leaving Darnell to coach the team. Darnell, a second-team all-Big Eight linebacker in the late 1960s at Oklahoma State, served as an assistant at Kansas State, North Carolina, Oklahoma State, SMU and Wake Forest before coming to Florida in January, 1988. He also was the head coach at Tennessee Tech for three seasons (1983-85). The Gators beat Vanderbilt, 34-11, in his debut. A week later, they followed with a 27-21 homecoming victory over New Mexico in which Smith rushed for a school-record 316 yards. But then Florida lost three of its last four to fall into a fourth-place tie in the SEC. "We had a good year," Darnell said. "There were probably one or two games that could have gone either way. Maybe the resolve became stronger because of (the turmoil) and we learned to rely on one another. There were a lot of lessons learned from this." The Freedom Bowl, untroubled by Florida's off-the-field problems, came calling and the Gators eagerly accepted. It's nice to be wanted. And not just by NCAA investigators.

Title: NHL ROUNDUP; HEALY MAKES 41 SAVES AS ISLANDERS WIN 5TH IN ROW
Author: Associated Press
Abstract: null
Text: Coach Al Arbor of the New York Islanders believes in giving credit where credit is due, and after his team beat the St. Louis Blues, 3-2, Thursday night in New York, he thought all of it belonged to goalie Glenn Healy. "He won the game by himself," Arbour said after Healy made 41 saves in helping the Islanders extend their winning streak to five games. Pat LaFontaine provided the offense with his third consecutive two-goal game and added an assist as the Islanders continued their home domination of the Blues. St. Louis is 4-22-9 at Nassau Coliseum. LaFontaine tied the game, 1-1, at 17:29 of the first period, and Alan Kerr put the Islanders ahead to stay at 6:35 of the second. North Stars 1, Blackhawks 1 -- Denis Savard scored late in the second period at Chicago to give the Blackhawks a tie with the North Stars in a game preceded by a seven-minute brawl. The North Stars took a 1-0 lead at 7:53 on Neal Broten's goal. The disturbance broke out midway through the pregame warmup when Chicago's Wayne Van Dorp and Minnesota's Shane Churla began fighting near the penalty benches. Players from both teams quickly joined the melee.

Author: null
Abstract: null
Text: Sixteen South Bay players, including seven from 4-A Division runner-up Carson High, have been named to All-L.A. City Section football teams by the Amateur Athletic Foundation board of sportswriters. Carson was represented on the 32-player 4-A team by quarterback Armin Youngblood, wide receiver Michael Ross, center Raul Nieto, defensive linemen Marcus Long and Bob Tuitau, linebacker Nkosi Littleton and defensive back Clayvand Thomas. The Colts, who finished 10-2 and lost in the championship game to Dorsey, 26-15, placed the most players on the team. Dorsey and Crenshaw were second with six each. The only other area player chosen to the 4-A team was Banning linebacker John Herrera. Junior running back Lamont Warren of Dorsey was named 4-A Player of the Year, and Dorsey wide receiver Kevin Copeland, who died of heart failure Oct. 6 in a game with San Pedro, was named honorary captain. The South Bay was represented by eight players on the 3-A team. Westchester topped local selections with three, while Gardena and San Pedro each placed two. Narbonne had one. Named to the offensive unit were San Pedro quarterback Arnie Madrid and center Corey Miller, Westchester tailback Tim Holliday, Gardena wide receiver Manley Woods and Narbonne kicker Wilfred Rodriguez. Westchester lineman Darren Johnson and linebacker Butch Hahn were defensive selections, as was Gardena lineman Alex Martinez. Record-breaking quarterback Santiago Alvarez (4,119 yards, 52 touchdowns passing) of division champion Franklin and Venice's versatile Louis Jones, who played virtually every skill position during the season, shared 3-A Player of the Year honors.

Title: PEPPERDINE'S POWER FORWARD, GEOFF LEAR, 'KING' OF THE COURT; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THE WAVES' SOPHOMORE, WITH THE SIZE AND SKILLS TO BECOME AS TOP POWER FORWARD, HAS SHOWN FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE AGAINST SOME OF THE NATION'S BEST.
Author: RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: Not surprisingly, Pepperdine's Geoff Lear is nicknamed "King" after the Shakespearean protagonist, and he may one day earn the right to be considered royalty in college basketball. At 6-foot-8 and 230 pounds, Lear looks as if he is physically capable of imposing his reign over most of the nation's other power forwards. However, he has not yet demonstrated that he always has sufficient skills to govern wisely throughout his career. Only a sophomore, he showed flashes of brilliance in his freshman year against such veterans as Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers, the nation's leading scorer and rebounder last season, and Cliff Robinson, then of the University of Connecticut and now with the Portland Trailblazers of the National Basketball Assn. In describing Lear at Pepperdine's basketball press day before the season, Coach Tom Asbury sounded as if he were talking about a crown prince. Asbury said that Lear is "a guy anybody in America would like to have. He's real strong and physical, (and) he had some of his best games" as a freshman when he appeared to be overmatched. Last week he had two of his best games in a Pepperdine uniform. He scored a career-high 25 points and added 10 rebounds in an 81-71 victory over UC Irvine. A couple of nights later, he scored 22 points and had seven rebounds in a 99-71 rout of Western Washington. If he continues to hold court like that throughout the season, the graduate of La Puente Bishop Amat High School could help end the reign of Gathers and Loyola in the West Coast Conference, where the Lions have run rampant for the last two years. He said he may have been spurred to a good night against UC Irvine because he was playing against Ricky Butler, who outshone Lear when Ocean View High ousted Bishop Amat from the CIF-Southern Section playoffs a couple of years ago. "When someone beats you (as Ocean View and Butler did to Bishop Amat), you've got to put the revenge factor to work," said Lear, sounding as if he had been dethroned by Butler. He might not have been in a position to exact his revenge if he had not listened to his father in his senior year in high school. Lear had signed an early letter of intent with Pepperdine in November, 1987, after he had been recruited by former Wave Coach Jim Harrick. When Harrick left Pepperdine to become UCLA's head coach in the spring of 1988, Lear seriously considered going to another school and losing a year of basketball eligibility as required by NCAA rules. He said that he heard about Harrick's appointment on a radio broadcast and that he was "real shocked. How could he do that to me when he had recruited me." He said that Asbury, who succeeded Harrick as Pepperdine's coach, visited him and tried to persuade him that it was not in his best interests to go to another college. "Originally, I didn't like Coach Asbury. I thought he was trying to pressure me. "But my father talked me into (staying committed to Pepperdine). He told me, 'Why make trouble for yourself?' So I came here, and I fell in love with the place." Asbury said that he, not Harrick, ordinarily would have recruited Lear because recruiting was one of his chief responsibilities as a Pepperdine assistant coach. But at the time, he said, he was in Seattle, talking to Doug Christie about playing for Pepperdine. Asbury was successful in persuading guard-forward Christie, then considered one of the top prep players in Washington, to come to Pepperdine. Christie and Lear are now roommates, and they are playing well for the Waves. Asbury said that when Lear had been cool toward him "it was not so much a matter of not liking me as of not knowing me. But I had watched him in summer leagues and was part of the decision-making process to recruit him." Still, he added, he is grateful that Lear's father is "big on commitment." Asbury has been big on Lear. "I think he's improving with every game, and he was probably the dominating player in the program in fall practice." Lear and Asbury agree that he can be more dominating at power forward than at center, but circumstances have dictated that he play both positions at times. "The post is one of my strong points," Lear said. "If the other guy is bigger than me, I try to out-quick him. If he is quicker than me, I try to out-muscle him. "But I would rather play forward because there's more freedom there. You have a center behind you, and if your man gets free, he can block his shot." Improved in Class Lear has improved in his positions both on the court and in the classroom since his freshman year. As a reserve last year, he averaged five points and 4.9 rebounds a game. In Pepperdine's first seven games this season, he averaged 14 points and a team-high 7.9 rebounds. "A lot of it with him is confidence," Asbury said. He is not particularly confident when it comes to shooting free throws. Last season he made only 53.7%, and this year he is not much better (57.7%). His confidence may be building, however; against Irvine, he was nine of 11 at the line. His confidence is definitely growing in his studies. Last year, he said, he had a grade-point average of 2.1 (on a four-point scale). Last term it rose to a 3.1, he said. He is majoring in business and wants to go into hotel administration, possibly after playing pro basketball. He is not placing all his hopes on becoming a pro and is "going to try my darndest" to graduate in four years. He attended summer school after his freshman year and plans to do so again. The transition from high school to college has been difficult but good for him, he said. "I like the feeling of having a lot of responsibility. The coaches are going to care about you, but they're not going to make you get up in the morning and go to class." He likes the responsibility of living up to the praise given him by Asbury. The coach has compared him to former Pepperdine power forward Orlando Phillips, who was a menacing and strong defender and a top rebounder. But he said he wants to be himself on the court, not a replica of someone else. "I don't want to be anybody else. I'm not trying to be a second Orlando or a second Magic (Johnson). I'd rather be Geoff the First and have people follow in my footsteps." He said he enjoys playing against Gathers or others with strong claims to be the best in the college game. He said he also welcomes chances to get revenge on opposing players who have had great nights against him. "Those are big games, and I just live to play big games."

Title: DISPUTE AMONG CAMPBELL HEIRS BOILS OVER; THREE SAY THEY'LL SELL
Author: Times Staff and Wire Reports
Abstract: FEUDS; CAMPBELL SOUP CO; FAMILIES; DIVESTMENT; SECURITIES
Text: The family that has controlled the Campbell Soup Co. for more than a century and made its red-and-white soup cans a common sight in the nation's cupboards has split over ownership of the giant food maker. Three nieces of Campbell's late chairman, John T. Dorrance Jr., and their husbands on Thursday said they want to sell their 17% stake in Campbell. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it would seek "a price per share significantly in excess of current market value." Shares, until the past several days, had been trading in the $40 range. The group also said it would encourage Campbell's directors to do the same and consider ousting those who oppose a sale. One of the nieces, Dorrance Hamilton, sits on the company's board. Last week, three children of Dorrance, who died last April, issued a statement saying they intended to maintain their ownership in Campbell and keep the company independent. The three recently received control of their father's 31.3% stake in the company. A Campbell spokesman said the company had no comment. Rumors of a simmering family dispute have stirred up takeover speculation and boosted the price of Campbell shares in recent weeks. On Thursday, Campbell shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose $4.375 to close at $57.375. Thursday's filing "magnifies and brings to actuality the discord we've been hearing about among the family," said Mary Harden, an analyst with Duff & Phelps in Chicago. The Dorrance family has been involved with the company since 1876, when Arthur Dorrance joined a fruit and vegetable canning partnership founded by Joseph Campbell in 1869 in Camden, N.J. The company's fortunes took off after Dorrance's nephew, John Thompson Dorrance, invented condensed soup. The product, which removed water from the soup, permitted a more convenient method to distribute canned soups nationwide. John Thompson Dorrance, who was Campbell's president when he died in 1914, left behind an estate valued at $115 million, according to Everybody's Business, a guide on corporate history and information. Dorrance's son, John Thompson Dorrance Jr., eventually became chairman of the company. Under the Dorrances, Campbell developed a reputation as a strait-laced, no-nonsense company. Smoking was prohibited in its Camden, N.J., headquarters, and most Campbell executives shared their offices with secretaries to save on expenses. Besides a commercial success, Campbell's soup became an American icon of sorts. Late pop artist Andy Warhol used Campbell soup labels in many of his works. Campbell slowly began to diversify by buying other food makers, such as Pepperidge Farm products, Swanson frozen dinners and Vlasic pickles. But in recent years, analysts have faulted the company for failing to modernize its facilities and come up with new products to keep up with competitors. Campbell has sought to boost profits by shuttering plants and laying off workers. The most recent shutdown included Campbell's original canning factory in Camden. For the fiscal year ended July 30, Campbell reported sales of $5.7 billion and earnings of $13.1 million, sharply lower from $274.1 million the previous year. The profit decline was blamed on the cost of factory shutdowns. In November, R. Gordon McGovern stepped down as Campbell's chief executive and president; he has yet to be replaced. Harden said the dissenting family members may have difficulty finding a prospective buyer willing to pay top price for Campbell. "They're assuming it's somebody out there with deep pockets," she said. "I'm not certain in this investment environment that they're going to find an investor . . . willing to pay the kind of prices they're looking for." CAMPBELL SOUP CO. AT A GLANCE The Camden, N.J., firm's units include Campbell's soups, Swanson frozen foods, Prego spaghetti sauce, Pepperidge Farm bakery products and Godiva chocolates.

Title: CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S.J. DIAMOND: BEST (OR WORST?) OF THIS YEAR'S COMPLAINTS
Author: S.J. DIAMOND
Abstract: CONSUMERS; COMPLAINTS; BUSINESS ETHICS; CUSTOMER SERVICE; 1989 (YEAR)
Text: Following is my annual select assortment of questionable products, services, pitches and practices, as reflected in one year's calls and letters from consumers. Many were already familiar, involving utilities, banks, insurance, time share properties, prize giveaway promotions, the IRS, retail service, credit cards, telemarketing and, of course, the invariable problems with new cars and car repairs. First, a twist on the tired old sweepstakes promotion, introduced by Reader's Digest in 1962 and so consistently the company's primary method of pitching magazines, books and videocassettes that an entire generation associates Reader's Digest less with publishing than with lotteries. This year, some of the Digest sweepstakes letters came from executives at Pennsylvania's Mellon Bank, heralding the imminent mailing of official entry cards for a $5 million or $10 million sweepstakes (preferably to be returned with subscription order as well). One such letter assured recipients -- who had "already made it through the first two stages of the sweepstakes" -- that the funds were already on deposit. The other discussed the financial plan that Mellon could devise for the winner. Reader's Digest wanted the recipient's attention and trust, drawn by the "third party endorsement" implicit in a "letter signed by an officer of a well-known bank," says Digest spokesman Craig Lowder. Mellon wanted "the opportunity to be introduced to the winner," says Mellon spokesman Norma Buhrman, "to offer them some financial planning." Meantime, it gets those funds on deposit. The public wanted to know whether Mellon was indeed endorsing the contest and whether this was proper; some wondered whether any credibility somehow given to the sweepstakes didn't also diminish the bank's credibility. I want to know whether magazine marketing will ever again try to sell a product on its own merit, rather than by some gimmick that has nothing to do with reading, writing or entertainment. Next, a challenge to all retailing in the suit just filed by New York's state attorney general against Sears, Roebuck & Co., charging that its new and heavily advertised "everyday low prices" are no lower than its old "sale" prices, which were actually the store's regularly charged prices on many goods. Indeed, Sears had settled a previous false advertising action in 1986, paying $75,000 and promising to cease deceptive sales practices -- specifically, said the attorney general, comparing "sale" prices to inflated, rarely charged, essentially fictitious "regular" prices. Sears' announcement this year that everyday prices were being lowered across the board is just more false advertising, says the attorney general. Sears's new prices, say attorney general investigators, while naturally lower than the old fictitious "regular" prices, are often equal to or higher than previous "sale" prices. The nation's biggest retailer has special troubles now -- unable to find a niche between today's attractive discounters and upscale department stores. But the offense with which it is charged is an old story in retailing, where comparative price advertising is more semantics than a statement of value. The Sears case best serves to remind consumers that constant sales and special purchases and "XX% Off" promotions are evidence of advertising policy, not pricing structure. Next, the most over-mailed mailer mailed this year: TRW's relentless offer of Credentials Service, which for $35 a year provides unlimited copies of one's credit report, notification whenever someone orders the report and the chance to store a filled-in credit application in TRW's computer. The nation's biggest credit reporting bureau, TRW is thus burning its candle at both ends -- selling credit grantors information on consumers and selling nervous consumers a look at the information it has on them. Since its 1986 introduction, Credentials Service has been widely offered -- up to 10 million pieces in a mailing -- and widely subscribed, with 1 million members now. It's also of questionable value: One should review one's credit report periodically, but such reports (which list all recent orders for copies) are available to consumers for the asking ($8 in California, $2 to $15 in other states). Anyone denied credit gets one free. Moreover, most people want one only when they're about to apply for a loan, and even Credential Service members only order a couple a year, on average: Why bother subscribing? Obviously there's money in nervous consumers -- for TRW and for co-marketers like Chase Manhattan Bank, Broadway stores, Charles Schwab and others willing to tout the service to their customers in return for commissions from TRW. And now TRW and other credit reporting bureaus never will feel obliged to verify adverse information provided by creditors, or to notify consumers (free) of faulty information that's about to cause them trouble. Finally, we must give recognition to marketing ploys so widely practiced now that they've become traditions, and consumer inquiries have virtually stopped. One is the persuasive offer of a "pre-approved" credit line or loan, which nevertheless requires income information, employer's name and address, and a credit check to see whether the applicant's "credit status has changed since pre-approval" (Chase Manhattan's wording). Another is the credit card "protection" pressed on every cardholder, providing "registration" (listing) of all one's cards, creditor notification of lost or stolen cards and some extra junk (accident insurance, emergency cash, etc.). All too often now, automatic enrollment and urgency are implied ("Detach and mail the top portion of this form right away," says Robinson's in Los Angeles), and fees are obscured, buried perhaps in a small-print list of benefits that one is getting. But if consumers have learned enough suspicion now to protect themselves from such small persuasions, why do so many, presented with an obviously suspect deal, so willingly throw all suspicion away? There seemed an unusually high number of calls this year from people who had bought everything from trash bags to gems to computer systems over the phone and everything from audio speakers to car repairs from strangers who approached them in parking lots or on sidewalks. All their stories began with "I know I was stupid" and ended with a request for help. Sigh . . .

Title: MYERSON & KUHN LAW FIRM FILES FOR CHAPTER 11; ATTORNEYS: THE FIRM HAS NOT MATCHED THE AMBITIONS OF ITS FOUNDERS, LITIGATOR HARVEY MYERSON AND BOWIE KUHN, FORMER BASEBALL COMMISSIONER.
Author: PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: BANKRUPTCY; LAW FIRMS; MYERSON & KUHN; MYERSON, HARVEY; KUHN, BOWIE
Text: Myerson & Kuhn, an elite law firm built last year when one of the nation's largest firms went bankrupt, has itself filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Founded by flamboyant litigator Harvey Myerson and former baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, the firm one year ago boasted a staff of 160 lawyers, including big-name talent that it attracted with hefty salaries. But the firm's receipts never matched its ambitions, and Myerson & Kuhn has been cited as an example of how today's big firms can elude management control. The firm sought bankruptcy court protection in a petition filed Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. Among the firm's creditors was Marine Midland Bank, which was listed on the petition as being owed $3 million. The firm and some of its remaining partners still face a sizable claim from a former client, the Shearson Lehman Hutton investment firm. In one of the heaviest blows to the firm, Shearson last year fired Myerson & Kuhn and then sued it for allegedly overbilling the brokerage by at least $2 million. Shearson settled for $1.2 million last June. But this week the investment firm filed a new suit, claiming that the law firm still owed $488,000 of the settlement. Myerson & Kuhn was organized by trial lawyer Myerson two months after the November, 1987, collapse of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Unterberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey, a law firm that was then the nation's fourth largest. Myerson launched the firm with a fanfare of publicity and a pledge that it would have first-year revenue of $50 million to $75 million. He described the organization as a "start-up superstar firm" with a client list that included Shearson, the Trump Organization and Weyerhaeuser Co. But the firm never reached that revenue goal and had a falling out with Donald Trump, in addition to Shearson. Among Myerson & Kuhn's original hires were such widely recognized names as Faith Ryan Whittlesey, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, and Gerald Eppner, a top corporate lawyer. During much of this year, Myerson & Kuhn saw a stream of defections from its offices in New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Philadelphia. In Los Angeles, the firm's office fell from a peak of 19 lawyers to 12. Earlier this month, the Los Angeles lawyers broke away from the home office and set up shop under a new name, Cooper & Dempsey, according to partner Michael D. Dempsey. Still unclear at this point is exactly what will happen to the leases on the Los Angeles group's office space and equipment, which are held under the Myerson & Kuhn name and are thus included in the bankruptcy proceeding. "For the moment, we're stuck in this," Dempsey said. Myerson is now forming a firm of his own in New York, while Kuhn, 62, is reportedly considering retiring.

Title: SUIT ALLEGES HARASSMENT BY ROCKWELL
Author: RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: INFORMERS; SUITS; HARASSMENT; ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL; FRAUD; SPACE SHUTTLE; ENGINEERS; SOLOMON, RIA; WITNESSES
Text: A former aerospace worker at the Johnson Space Center in Houston who blew the whistle on alleged fraud on the space shuttle has accused Rockwell International of a bizarre scheme of harassment, according to a court brief filed Thursday. Ria Solomon alleges in a federal suit that Rockwell security agents illegally used information from a Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal information computer to discredit Rockwell engineers who were corroborating her allegations. Solomon is suing Rockwell in U.S. District Court in Houston under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. A fellow worker who was a co-plaintiff in the suit settled with Rockwell earlier this year. The suit brought by Solomon alleges that after she reported time-card fraud and technical problems on the space shuttle program to a Rockwell ombudsman, the company's security department began a campaign of harassment. Solomon worked for Unisys, a subcontractor under Rockwell at the Houston center. Rockwell manages certain functions at the Houston center for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Solomon was fired by Unisys in May, 1987, and sued later that year, naming both Rockwell and Unisys. She settled with Unisys last year. Rockwell officials could not be reached for comment. In the court filing Thursday, Solomon alleges that Rockwell assistant general counsel Bette Bardeen directed two Rockwell security agents in Houston to gather evidence to discredit witnesses for Solomon. Logs compiled by the two security agents, Danny Myers and James Roberts, indicate that their activities were reported to Bardeen, according to Lynne Bernabei, Solomon's attorney. Myers was also a police officer in El Lago, a Texas municipality. He used that connection to use the FBI's national criminal information computer to obtain information about a witness in the suit, the legal brief alleges. The brief also alleges that Rockwell security agents conducted physical surveillance of a second witness in 1987 and 1988. When the witness reported suspicious activity to the local police department, the agency notified Rockwell of the report, according to the brief. The police agency also allegedly destroyed a report identifying individuals who were making harassing telephone calls to the witness.

Title: L.F. ROTHSCHILD REACHES ACCORD WITH CREDITORS
Author: Associated Press
Abstract: BANKRUPTCY; L F ROTHSCHILD HOLDINGS INC
Text: L. F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., parent of a respected Wall Street brokerage crushed in the 1987 stock market crash, said Thursday that it had reached agreement with creditors on a bankruptcy court reorganization plan. The plan, which needs approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, restructures $101 million in debt on which the parent of L. F. Rothschild & Co. defaulted in June. Rothschild Holdings issued a statement saying its committee of unsecured creditors had approved the restructuring proposal. The brokerage subsidiary was not included in the bankruptcy court filing. Since its parent sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law in June, Rothschild & Co. has shuffled its management and scaled down its businesses in an effort to stay alive as a smaller brokerage. "We've gone about trying to intelligently refocus the broker-dealer, which was never part of the bankruptcy," Rothschild Chief Executive Joel E. Miller said in an interview. "We're small and lean and well capitalized for what we do." Founded in 1899, the brokerage now has 45 workers.

Title: FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS RECORD A MODEST GAIN; DOW RISES 7.90
Author: Times Wire Services
Abstract: null
Text: Wall Street stocks finished with a modest gain Thursday in light trading that was lifted by a flurry of late buy orders on the next-to-last trading day of the year. Traders said year-end portfolio changes accounted for much of the activity, with some portfolio managers selling losing stocks for tax reasons and some buying more shares of the year's big winners. The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 7.90 to 2,732.30, closing at its high for the day. In the broader market, advancing stocks led declines by 832 to 675 on light volume of 128 million shares compared to 133.7 million on Wednesday. "We have a strike among buyers and sellers. There's no conviction and no urgency, and everybody is waiting for someone else to set the trend," said Michael Metz, a strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. Walt Disney stock rebounded 3 to 112 1/4. On Wednesday, the shares fell 4 1/2 as investors reacted to news that its chief financial officer, Gary Wilson, will give up some posts at the company but stay on in others. Campbell Soup Co. jumped 4 3/8 to 57 3/8. A group of Dorrance family members that control 17.4% of the stock said they wanted to sell their holdings for a price in excess of current market value. Champion International rose 1 3/8 to 30 3/4. Champion said Laurence A. Tisch of Loews Corp. recently sought clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to buy up to 15%. The Germany Fund jumped 1 3/4 to 19 despite a statement issued from fund managers saying that net asset value was $12.16 a share and that the price increase was "exaggerated." Microsoft fell 1 to 85 1/4 after news late Wednesday that its president, Jon Shirley, plans to retire. Bullish sentiment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Thursday lifted the key Nikkei index to a new high for the third straight session in dull trading, but prices eased later in the day. The average of 225 issues gained 75.31 points to close at 38,876.94. In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 3.0 points, or 0.1%, to close at 2,398.8. CREDIT Bonds Continue Their Recovery Bond prices advanced moderately in light trading Thursday, rebounding from a selloff earlier this week. The Treasury's 30-year bond gained 7/32 point, or about $2.19 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield fell to 7.96% from 7.98% late Wednesday. Bonds got some support from gains made by the dollar, but much of the advance "was a rebound from the oversold condition that occurred Tuesday," said William V. Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 8 3/8%, down from 8 3/4% late Wednesday. CURRENCY Dollar Advances in New York Trading The dollar finished sharply higher in domestic trading Thursday after putting in a mixed performance overseas. Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $398.60 an ounce, down $2.20 from Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $399.50 an ounce, off $1.50. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 142.15 Japanese yen from 142.10 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, it rose to 143.15 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 143.55, up from 142.00 Wednesday. In London, the British pound fell to $1.6137 from $1.6255 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.6045 to buy one pound, cheaper than Wednesday's $1.6275. Tables begin on D6

Title: WINTER FARE CUTS SPREAD TO SEVERAL MORE AIRLINES
Author: Times Wire Services
Abstract: AIRLINES -- UNITED STATES; FARES
Text: More airlines cut fares on Thursday in a growing effort to fill empty seats during the traditionally slow winter months. The fare reductions, in effect through early March, apply only to about 10% of the airlines' routes, but they involve densely traveled routes. The move was started by Midway Airlines, which on Tuesday announced one-way fares ranging from $19 to $99 across its 50-city route system within the Continental United States. United Airlines followed suit on Wednesday, and its cuts were quickly matched in the same markets by Northwest, Delta and Trans World. Spokesmen for American and Continental airlines said Thursday that those carriers have matched the move. "We've got to be competitive," said Ed Stewart, a spokesman for American at its headquarters at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. American, the nation's largest airline, will cut fares to about 40 cities from Chicago. That compares to its total network of around 1,200 markets. American's round-trip fares between Los Angeles and New York, for example, will be cut to $278-$318 from $398-$438. Between Boston and Nashville, Tenn., fares will drop to $178-$198 from $238-$278. The discounts affect flights among New York, Boston and Los Angeles and include other cities in the Continental United States. Arizona, Florida and Nevada are excluded. Travelers must buy their tickets two weeks in advance and meet other requirements to obtain the fares.

Title: PAN AM OBJECTS TO EASTERN'S SALE OF ROUTES
Author: ROBERT E. DALLOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS; TRANSPORTATION ROUTES; LATIN AMERICA -- TRANSPORTATION; EASTERN AIRLINES; AMERICAN AIRLINES; AIRLINES -- LATIN AMERICA; AIRLINE WORKERS -- LABOR RELATIONS; AIRLINES -- LAYOFFS
Text: Pan American World Airways said Thursday that it would vigorously fight the planned sale to American Airlines of Eastern Airlines' routes in Latin America. Meanwhile, Eastern announced that it planned to cut 600 jobs, mostly managerial, in connection with the proposed transaction. It also announced wage cuts. The objection by Pan Am was not surprising given that it is a major competitor in Latin America of Eastern and American. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said Thursday that the agency is looking into the proposed sale on antitrust grounds and will listen to any third parties who oppose it. "We strongly object to the further concentration of American's market dominance in Latin America and the Caribbean through the purchase of government route authorities and facilities," said Pamela Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman. "With its already significant operations in the Caribbean and Latin America, American's purchase of these routes is clearly anti-competitive." Hanlon said three U.S. carriers currently serve the area -- American, Pan Am and Eastern. "With the American-Eastern agreement, there will be, in effect, only two competitors." Eastern announced on Dec. 19 that it would sell its Latin American routes and a number of other facilities for $471 million. It needs the funds to operate while in bankruptcy proceedings and to pay its creditors. The Miami-based carrier filed for bankruptcy protection in March, five days after it was struck by its machinists, pilots and flight attendants. It plans to file a reorganization plan and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings early next year. Hanlon said Pan Am planned to file its objections with both the Transportation and Justice departments. Hal Paris, a Transportation Department spokesman, said neither Pan Am nor anyone else had yet filed in opposition to the proposed sale. But, he said, if there were such a filing, "we would make a careful review of the sale of any international routes to see if it would have any effect on competition." A Justice spokeswoman said that agency also had not heard anything from Pan Am. American declined comment on the Pan Am objection. Eastern also said it would implement employee wage reductions of 20% for six months and 10% the following six months, mostly for non-union workers. Although it plans to reduce its 19,000-person work force by 600, it will try to find positions elsewhere for these people.

Title: WATER, (DESIGNER) WATER EVERYWHERE
Author: ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: BOTTLED WATER; TRENDS; HEALTH FOOD; LIFESTYLES
Text: Forget about Swatch watches, "Wall Street" suspenders or braided-yarn friendship bracelets. The most intriguing accessory to come out of the '80s is the Evian water bottle. Water does a body good, and if you don't believe it, just gaze at those sexy, muscular, minimally clad men and women in the Evian ads. Of course, real-life water bodies -- those people you see running around town with their own portable water -- deny they're doing anything chic or trendy. They're just working on another aspect of fitness. "I won't drink tap water because I don't trust it. I want to look after my body, which is probably getting destroyed from the air anyway," lamented actress Marla Garmire, on her way out the door of a Los Angeles health club, empty Evian bottle in hand. Leaving another health club, Jon Doyle, a 35-year-old sales rep, had an empty bottle at his side. It was an Evian container, minus the label, refilled with water from his home supply of Hinckley & Schmitt. Where else does Doyle take his plain-wrap accessory? "On the road. On the golf course. And certainly to the beach. When was the last time you drank water at the beach?" he demanded to know, adding he was turned off by its taste. At UCLA, the campus is frequently awash with bottle-brandishing students. Senior Tawnya Southern, who had just topped off an aerobics workout with a bit of Canadian NAYA, explained that carrying your own water around "shows you care about what you put in your body." For 21-year-old Janine Arena, it solves a threefold problem: "I don't like diet drinks because of the chemicals. Juice has too many calories and L.A. tap water tastes awful." As for 17-year-old Roy Ahn, he said the smell and taste of chlorine in the city water supply drove him to drink from supposedly purer sources. Having gained acceptance in the '80s as an accessory, the water bottle is not about to disappear. In fact, a survey by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power indicates the CYOB (Carry Your Own Bottle) trend is on the rise. But company spokeswoman Mindy Berman insists customers needn't worry about city water, which "meets all state and federal standards and is completely safe to drink." To spread the word -- and get residents back on tap -- DWP has launched a public information campaign that includes one sobering detail: Designer drinking water costs 800 times more than old-fashioned H20.

Title: LITERARY CRUSADER WRITES STORIES ABOUT REAL KIDS
Author: JIM NAUGHTON, THE WASHINGTON POST
Abstract: MYERS, WALTER DEAN; WRITERS; CHILDREN'S LITERATURE; BLACKS; YOUTH
Text: Walter Dean Myers is an accidental pioneer. Twenty years ago, when he began writing fiction for young readers, he was just hoping it would provide a better living than delivering messages. But the children's literature of the late '60s was so monochromatic that Myers became a one-man movement, simply by writing about the world as he knew it, a world that included Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant and the Lower East Side. His first book, the illustrated story of a trip to the park, was criticized in the industry because it had no white characters. His second, the tale of a lovelorn dragon, provoked letters urging Myers to desist under pain of death. Correspondents were particularly incensed by a black fairy named Mabel Mae who said such things as, "Face it baby, that knight is a bad dude." "There had never been a black fairy before," Myers says by way of still bewildered explanation. "Especially a black fairy that sort of had jive talk." In the 20 years since Mabel Mae broke the color line, her creator has become an institution in the low-profile world of children's fiction. His books are consistently named to the American Library Association's list of the Best Books for Young Adults. But it is his subjects as much as his skill that sets Myers apart. He is the only successful novelist in America who has devoted his career to writing for and about inner-city kids. "I get to see these kids the way most writers don't," says Myers. "I can go to kids' homes. I see their parents. I have the knowledge of what's going on. So I have an obligation to all the kids who are voiceless." Myers lives with his wife, Connie, and their 15-year-old son, Chris, in a modest row house on the main drag in this gritty town at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel. A school stands across the street. There is a playground around the corner where he and Chris shoot hoops with neighborhood kids. "What happens is that I see these kids at 11, I see them at 12 and then two years later I see them in trouble, and I wonder about that," he says. Myers is a calm, somewhat distracted man whose unpretentious manner undercuts an intense concern about inner-city problems ranging from teen pregnancy to drug abuse. Although at 50 his days as a playground rat are well behind him, he keeps in touch with children by teaching creative writing twice each month at a nearby public school. "The kids there are 12 and 13, and they write about their problems," he says. "Say here's a kid that's coming in, and instead of writing a story about a teddy bear or their favorite Christmas, they are writing about a friend who is OD'ing on crack. Or there was one story about a girl who came home and her mother was on crack. She said she wanted to try crack, too." These students might well be Myers' characters. In 1975, with "Fast Sam, Cool Clyde and Stuff," he began writing his spare, realistic novels about growing up in the ghetto. The children he wrote about were seldom particularly athletic or particularly smart. They lost fistfights, struggled in school and felt alternately tempted and threatened by the world exploding around them. Like Myers himself, many were foster children. They were living on the edge of indigence in neighborhoods plagued by poverty, violence and drug abuse. Yet Myers managed to evoke their sadness without robbing them of their dignity. "He tackles difficult topics, but he does it in a way that is not without hope," says Maria Salvadore, coordinator of children's services for the District of Columbia public library. "Younger people gain a sense of control through self-exploration in most of his work." "I just think he's tops," says Peggy Coughlin, reference specialist in children's literature at the Library of Congress. "It's the way he constructs the stories. There are very fine characters, a realistic setting and you have a strong plot, and it all works together." Myers has been much in demand as a speaker lately, and his books are reaching an increasingly wider audience. He won two important honors last year. But his new popularity may owe as much to the recent vogue of concern for "children at risk" as it does to his talent. These children have been Myers' subject -- and his audience -- for years, and there are few better sources on the problems they face and the hopes they nourish. In "The Young Landlords," for instance, Myers looks at what happens when a group of grade school friends buy an old apartment building for a dollar. The story, aimed at preteen readers, is a blend of social commentary and whodunit, spiced with almost slapstick comedy. It won the Coretta Scott King Award in 1979. "Motown and Didi: A Love Story" won the same award five years later, but it is an entirely different sort of book. More violent and more philosophical, it tells the story of a stoic young man living in an abandoned apartment whose life is convulsed when he helps a proud, brainy girl whose brother is on heroin. In "Scorpions," a 12-year-old trying to raise money to appeal his brother's robbery conviction is talked into taking over a drug gang. Desperate for protection, he acquires the gun that will change his life. By creating a world in which there are no good choices, Myers shows how easy it is for good kids to go wrong. The novel was named a Newbery Honor Book, which, in children's literature, is akin to being short-listed for the National Book Award. What unites the best of Myers' work is a handful of strong characters who are not subordinated to his issue-oriented plots. "I spend a lot of time working on characters," he says. "I start off with a resume. Actually it is an application form. You know, like a job application form that I have just extended a little bit. And I fill that out and sort of force myself to think about the characters. Then, if I am lucky, I will find a picture of my character. In a magazine. And I will go through hundreds of pictures to find pictures of my characters and find pictures of his house." When he's finished, his wife transforms the clippings into a big collage that spans one wall in the upstairs room where he does his writing. The characters that these methods help produce are the keys, he says, to inducing reluctant readers to tackle a book they might think is too bleak. "I talk to kids in schools and they would say, 'Well, I don't want to read anything about black life,' " he says. "And yet these were little black kids. So I am saying, 'Well, why?' "And then I realized that the reason was that so many of the books that were being published . . . were just so negative. And then I thought, 'Well how can you avoid that and still write a realistic book?' "And then I figured that you can avoid it by humanizing the kid. Giving the kids the same kinds of problems that everybody else has. And just saying it is OK to have this problem. Making the kid so human and real that the kid who is reading can identify with him." But the characters who make Myers' books so believable also make them controversial. Many parents object to their street-savvy language and to the depiction of a world they would rather their children not see. "These are people who really believe that society is going off the steep end," Myers says. "And I sympathize with them. I think they are misguided in what they are doing, but to some extent, they are at least trying to make a move." Myers came up against the censors most recently when he was asked to contribute a short story to an anthology of young adult fiction. The publishers specified that the girls in his story must be middle class and that they mustn't eat junk food or use bad language. "These were obviously things that were on the censors' list," Myers says. "So I did this thing about two middle-class black girls and their parents (who) owned a pet shop. The parents went to the next town. The two girls ran the pet shop, and they were placing the animals by their astrological signs." The story, called "The Aries Ape," was rejected because astrology was also on the censors' list. "Devil worship," Myers says, shaking his head. On the wall above the couch in Myers's darkened living room hangs the collage Connie Myers made for her husband's best-known book, "Fallen Angels." Published in 1988, it recently was released in paperback -- so recently that one of the big cardboard "dumps" that bookstores use to display popular books still stands in the doorway. "First time I ever had a dump," Myers says. "That's why it's up in the living room," his wife adds with a tolerant smile. "Fallen Angels," which also won the King award, is the first of Myers's books to be marketed for adults as well as teens. A young soldier's memoir of Vietnam, it has been compared to Michael Herr's "Dispatches" and Tim O'Brien's "Going After Cacciato." The novel's dedication is: "To my brother, Thomas Wayne 'Sonny' Myers, whose dream of adding beauty to this world through his humanity and his art ended in Vietnam on May 7, 1968." Therein lies the reason it was so difficult and so important for Myers to write it. "I joined the Army (in 1953) when I was 17 because I was in deep trouble and had a possibility of getting my little butt in jail or something like that," he says. "But that made me a hero. I went through the Army . . . I scored very, very well on my tests, and my Army career went accordingly. "My brother went in after me. And by the time he got in, the war was raging. And he got in just before the Tet Offensive. And he got into Vietnam at the height of it. And he was killed two days after he got there." Myers slides a bit more deeply into the couch, and for the first time in an hour or so takes his eyes off the person to whom he is speaking. "And I really felt to a large extent that my going in and coming out -- and having this uniform, which was the best clothing I'd ever had at the time -- affected him," he continues. "I really felt to a large extent that it was my fault that he went in. At least partially my fault, anyway." With "Fallen Angels," as with the novels that came before it, Myers was motivated by what he perceived as a responsibility. "I had an obligation," he says. "Since I had lost a brother there, I needed to write something to justify not only his experience, but the youth experience." Justifying the youth experience, in Vietnam or on the streets of Harlem or Jersey City, is still Myers's primary concern. It is a responsibility he feels all the more strongly because he knows that to some extent he is shouldering it alone. "Very few men think about writing stories for young people," he says. "And very few black men are writing at all. You tend to go where the publisher says, 'Here's a market, come here.' So if the market is Judith Krantz, and here's a black guy who wants to write about his environment. . . what can he do?" Myers is finishing a black history textbook and a novel about a difficult father-and-son relationship. Maybe, he says, when those projects are behind him, he will take on an issue still relatively untouched in young adult fiction: crack. "I haven't done anything really on a kid turning into a crack addict," he says. "But I could. I could do that, but that has to be something very, very special, and it has to have the right editor." He has already begun research that might one day be useful. "I did prison interviews, talked to kids in youth houses. It's up to somebody to write their stories. If not me, then who?"

Title: FALLEN O.C. SOLDIER, 19, FOUGHT 'THROUGH HELL'; FUNERAL: MORE THAN 200 MOURNERS LAY TO REST AN ARMY RANGER KILLED IN THE FIRST WAVE OF THE PANAMA INVASION.
Author: TONY MARCANO and RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS
Abstract: PANAMA -- REVOLTS; UNITED STATES -- ARMED FORCES -- PANAMA; MILITARY CONFRONTATIONS; ARMY (U.S.) -- PERSONNEL; FUNERALS
Text: Hundreds of mourners, led in prayer by a minister who urged them to "criticize the Noriegas" of the world, gathered Thursday at a military funeral for Army Pfc. Roy Dennis Brown Jr., killed in the first wave of the invasion of Panama. Brown, 19, who would have returned to his Buena Park home on leave Thursday, was instead eulogized as an Army Ranger who fought "through hell." Later, in a graveside ceremony that included a taps played by a bugler and seven soldiers in full dress firing three volleys into the air, Brown was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart. "As recently as Dec. 20, your freedom and my freedom was protected by the blood of this, our brother in Christ," the Rev. Wiley Drake, pastor of the First Southern Baptist Church in Buena Park, told more than 200 grieving friends and relatives who packed a chapel in Anaheim. Drake, speaking from a podium surrounded by floral arrangements a few feet from Brown's flag-draped coffin, urged the mourners not to criticize the invasion of Panama, but the reasons why President Bush -- whom he described as "Roy's commander-in-chief" -- sent U.S. forces there. "If we are quick to criticize, if we're quick to ask why, let us criticize the Noriegas, let us criticize the drug lords as Roy did and would, let us criticize those that would end our freedoms, and let us criticize those that would poison our young people," Drake said. Brown was among nearly a dozen U.S. soldiers buried this week in towns scattered from Pawtucket R.I., to Greenville S.C. Two other soldiers were also buried Thursday. In the Pennsylvania hamlet of Hallstead, hundreds of townspeople paused in their daily toils Thursday to say goodby to a fallen son, Sgt. Larry Barnard, 29, a father of three who was killed in the second day of the U.S. invasion. And in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va., a Peruvian family gathered for the funeral of Alejandro I. Manriquelozano, 30, who immigrated to Lauderhill, Fla., five years ago and had hopes of becoming a U.S. citizen. In all, 23 military personnel died in Panama, officials said. Brown was among the first troops assigned to attack in the Panama invasion, said Maj. Gen. Todd Graham, deputy commander of the 6th Army based at the Presidio in San Francisco. He said Brown was killed during an early-morning assault on Dec. 20 at Rio Hato, the site of a Panamanian Defense Force camp. Graham, who attended Brown's funeral, said 3,000 troops parachuted into the camp, a target that he said was essential to the success of the invasion. Brown's funeral began promptly at 11 a.m. with an emotional rendition of "America the Beautiful," followed by a reading of the 23rd Psalm by his maternal aunt and uncle, Mimi and Bill Campbell of Darby, Mont. Mimi Campbell later eulogized Brown as a full-of-life youngster who occasionally liked to play practical jokes. She later became more serious, especially about his military service. "Roy was really a special baby -- he was quick to come into the world," Campbell said. "It was a short 8 1/2-minute delivery, as if he was in a hurry to do what he had to do. More than 70 years he packed into 19 years of life. "I look at Roy's life like an unfrosted cake," she said later in her eulogy. "It didn't need the icing because it was wholesome and good just as it was." Campbell smiled and drew occasional chuckles with tales of Brown's mischievousness, but she choked up when she concluded her eulogy with a reading of a poem from the Army Ranger's handbook. In part, the poem read: "They blaze the trail to victory, where next no one can tell, but should they ever be called upon, they'll fight their way through hell." "Roy did that," Campbell said. Brown was also eulogized by John Halsey, director of the marching band at Anaheim's Magnolia High School, where Brown played the trombone. Halsey recalled Brown as "a gangly kid (who) really wanted to become involved in the music program" and later came to look on Halsey as "more or less like an uncle or older brother." "He had an impish smile, sort of a -- not a Dennis the Menace smile -- sort of like Opie, (from the old 'Andy Griffith Show')," Halsey said, drawing smiles and mild laughter from friends and family. "He had a lot of funny antics, but I can't share them all here now because some of his teachers may be here." The coffin was shut for the services, but it was open for a public viewing Wednesday. Brown was clad in his full-dress Army Ranger uniform, with his prized black beret tucked neatly beneath his left arm. After the funeral service Thursday, the family was allowed a few final private moments with Brown. His casket was carried out of the funeral home by six soldiers from the Ft. Ord funeral detachment. After the coffin was placed in the hearse, Brown's mother, Julie Otto, emerged from the chapel, clad in black, and carrying a single red rose. A contingent of motorcycle police then led the mourners on a 20-mile trip to Brown's grave site on a gently sloped hillside at the Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in East Orange. The short ceremony started with a reading of the "Infantrymen's Prayer," part of which read: "Give us courage, O Lord, in the face of danger." The prayer was followed by the gun salute, carried out by an honor guard that patiently stood at parade rest as the large contingent of mourners slowly filed up to the grave site. Many mourners dabbed at their eyes and others burst into tears as a lone bugler played taps. Sgt. John Arvan, a member of Brown's Ranger battalion who was assigned to escort the family, said conversations in the time he spent with them revealed that the family understood the importance of the mission. "They knew what he was doing," Jones said. "They didn't have . . . malice. . . . They knew it was his job." In Hallstead, Pa., Thursday, Panama seemed light years away from the community tragedy unfolding in the rolling dairy land along the Susquehanna River, the home of Sgt. Barnard. "If Larry ever brought anyone home, it was always someone who was hurting," said the Rev. Keith Benjamin in his sermon. "Whether he was volunteering to mow lawns for older neighbors or offering some other help, he was the kind of guy who could not pass a person on the street if he saw that they were suffering." Farther south, Manriquelozano was the first Panama casualty to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Manriquelozano was a young man whose Peruvian family saw him as both breadwinner and hope for the future. "He was the kind of guy who, if you had no shirt, he would give you his," said his cousin, Jose Canalas of Long Island, N.Y., a hotel manager. Under a bright winter sky, Alejandro's father, mother and other family members looked on sadly. The family was given two American flags and two Purple Hearts by Army officials. At the age of 25, the Peruvian immigrated to Florida, where he took a variety of jobs, including one as a kind of houseboy in Miami to Julio Iglesias, the popular singer. Iglesias sent flowers to Manriquelozano's funeral. He was a young man with an infectious smile, who had decided early that his dream of economic security and a better life for himself and his family lay to the north in the United States. He hoped to one day become a U.S. citizen. Larry Barnard had no such travails. The far reaches of northern Pennsylvania was countryside that Barnard loved deeply, his minister said, a place where as a teen-ager he would ride his horse over the ridge and into the forest to chop wood for his grandparents. Barnard, who married his high school sweetheart, Tammy, and had three children, never dreamed of anything but the Army -- "100% Army," as one friend described him a few days after his death. He volunteered for service right out of high school and eventually became a Ranger, a high-profile job that took him to the invasion of Grenada. Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey had visited with the Barnard family Wednesday, and President Bush sent a major general bearing condolences. But the real message was the 400 people -- seemingly the entire town -- who gathered in the freshly fallen snow at the United Methodist Church in Hallstead for the funeral of their friend, brother and son. When the chapel overflowed, 100 more crowded into a basement. "Thank you all so much for coming," were the only words Barnard's older brother, Ray, could manage. His father, Ray Sr., simply broke into tears, clutching the folded U.S. flag presented by the military. "His parents were always apprehensive (of his military work), but they were very aware and very proud of the fact that (the Army) was of his choosing," said longtime family friend Trudy Zurn.

Title: O.C. VICTIM OF ROMANIAN REVOLT TO BE BURIED THERE; PATRIOTISM: FULLERTON RESIDENT'S BROTHER, TRAVELING WITH HIM IN THEIR NATIVE LAND, TELLS HOW ION ANTIMIE WAS KILLED AND HE WAS WOUNDED IN AN ATTACK ON THEIR CAR.

Text: The bullet-riddled body of Ion (John) Antimie, the Fullerton man killed in his native Romania by security forces loyal to executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, is to be buried beside his mother in his homeland this weekend, with a memorial service in Anaheim next week, his family said Thursday. Family members also said that they now believe that the 21-year-old man was shot eight times during the weekend near the Romanian city of Cluj and that the rented car he had been driving was found punctured with more than 400 bullet holes. Those reports, still unconfirmed by the U.S. State Department, came Thursday after the family spoke for the first time late Wednesday night with John's 32-year-old brother, Constantine. The two brothers, both from Fullerton, were in Romania to deliver food and medical supplies after violence broke out during Ceausescu's bloody overthrow. "It sounded like a massacre," said brother-in-law James Ovi of Riverside. Relatives in Orange and Riverside counties had tried constantly for nearly three days without success to get through to Constantine, who they said has been staying with relatives in Romania since the attack by security forces.. Constantine told family members that he had been wounded twice when their moving car was sprayed with fire, once near his eye and also in his right leg, according to Ovi. "But he is OK." "He said he couldn't believe what has happened to him," Ovi recounted. "Before they got to the city of Cluj, he said they got away from three other attacks by the security forces; the last one was the worst, and John was dead." Constantine Antimie said he believes that he and his brother may have been attacked because they were driving a foreign car -- an Audi rented in West Germany -- possibly signaling to Ceausescu security forces that they might be carrying supplies from outside the country, according to Ovi. He said they were traveling alone at the time and were attacked by perhaps a dozen men. The two brothers, who helped run a construction business in Fullerton that the family started after coming from Romania four years ago, left Orange County before the start of bloodshed in Romania. John was planning to visit his girlfriend there. But they changed plans once the widespread violence and revolt began, staying over in West Germany for a few days last week to gather food and medical supplies for friends and relatives. Ovi said Constantine returned to the site of the attack with friends and retrieved his brother's body. It is to be buried Sunday next to his mother in the city of Margina. A public memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday at 7 p.m. in Anaheim at the Seventh-day Adventist Church, 900 S. Sunkist St.

Title: WOMAN GIVEN 2-YEAR TERM IN SHOOTING; COURTS: SHE ALLEGED THAT A NEIGHBOR RAPED HER, AND WHEN DISTRICT ATTORNEY DECLINED TO PROSECUTE, SHE SHOT THE MAN EIGHT TIMES. HE SURVIVED.
Author: DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: SHOOTINGS -- LOS ANGELES COUNTY; RAPE -- LOS ANGELES COUNTY; TRIALS; SENTENCING; ASSAULTS -- LOS ANGELES COUNTY
Text: A Los Angeles woman who shot her alleged rapist eight times was sentenced to two years in state prison Thursday. Noting that defendant Elizabeth Gooden, 26, "has had a history of not being able to control her temper," Los Angeles Municipal Judge Gary Klausner denied Gooden's request for probation and ordered her imprisoned. Gooden shot her neighbor, Wilson Piquet, outside his Crenshaw District apartment last July after the district attorney's office refused her request to file charges against him for allegedly raping her twice. After shooting Piquet once in the chest at point-blank range, Gooden shot him seven more times in the arms, legs and buttocks. Piquet, a school bus driver, survived. The district attorney's office maintained that there was insufficient evidence to support Gooden's rape accusations. Gooden, who originally faced an attempted murder charge, pleaded guilty last month to a reduced charge of assault with a deadly weapon. Klausner admitted that the alleged rape probably prompted Gooden to shoot Piquet, but he explained to the defense that it was not enough to keep her out of prison. "When you say she is not a danger to society, counsel, I cannot agree with that," he told Gooden's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Mark Zuckman. Klausner said his decision was based, in part, on the prosecutor's allegations that Gooden once stabbed another man she accused of hitting her and physically beat a woman she suspected of secretly dating her boyfriend. Zuckman maintained that Gooden had never been convicted of any of the alleged crimes. "She's law-abiding, and she's intelligent," Zuckman said. "She's not a danger to society. Now, perhaps she's a danger to rapists." Zuckman called the sentence "unfair." "It's disappointing," Zuckman said. "I really was hoping she'd get probation. She'll be out in about eight months. It could have been worse. She could have gotten a longer term for the attempted murder charge." Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia Wilkinson conceded that the rape allegations complicated the case. "Any time you're dealing with an individual claiming they have been assaulted, and they take matters into their own hands, you have a difficult situation," the prosecutor said. "But you just can't go out and take the law into your own hands and shoot someone." A clinical psychologist who examined Gooden months after the alleged rape maintained that the defendant was suffering from "rape trauma syndrome." She said the condition compelled Gooden to shoot Piquet. "The (sentencing) decision reflects a lack of understanding about the emotional distress of rape victims," said the psychologist, Dr. Nancy Kaser-Boyd, who attended Thursday's hearing. "Gooden's action was a result of her mental state."

Title: DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT PRINGLE; POLITICS: THE POLL GUARD CASE SETTLEMENT PROVIDES FODDER FOR DEMOCRATS' ATTEMPTS TO WIN THE 72ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SEAT. "PRINGLE IS THE NO. 1 TARGET," ONE POLITICO SAYS.

Text: As Orange County Republicans tried to put behind them this week's $400,000 settlement over the posting of security officers at Latino polling sites, local Democrats promised Thursday to use the explosive issue as their most potent weapon to defeat state Assemblyman Curt Pringle. Bolstering Democrats' hopes was the emergence of Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas Umberg, a federal prosecutor based in Santa Ana, as a strong potential candidate in the closely watched race for Pringle's Garden Grove seat in November, 1990. "This whole poll guard mess for the Republicans now moves from the legal realm to the political realm," said John Hanna, Democratic activist and former head of the county party. "Pringle is the No. 1 target on everyone's list," Hanna noted. "He is the most vulnerable Republican assemblyman in the state. He has the lowest (Republican) registration of any district in the county. He had the smallest margin of victory in the last race, and he has the biggest political scandal on his back." That scandal, in the view of Democrats, is the potential political fallout prompted by the Republicans' hiring of security guards who warned non-citizens not to vote at polling places in primarily Latino districts in Santa Ana last November. Pringle won the 72nd Assembly District contest by 867 votes. Republican officials responsible for the security guards this week finalized a $400,000 settlement with five Latino voters who brought a civil rights complaint over the incident, claiming harassment. The plaintiffs pledged to donate $150,000 of the settlement to Latino voter registration and education efforts. In a deposition taken as part of the lawsuit, Assemblyman John R. Lewis also disclosed that he once joked with other Republican officials about the possibility of driving green vans around polling places to give the impression that immigration officers were on hand. That never happened. Lewis, Republican county chairman Thomas A. Fuentes, Pringle and other Republican officials did not return repeated phone calls Thursday. Republican political consultant Eileen Padberg, declining to comment on the incident's political ramifications, observed: "There's been enough said on this one. I think everyone would just like to forget about it now." But another Republican strategist, Harvey Englander, said he believes that the issue may not hurt Pringle in the upcoming election. "The whole (poll guard) event was distasteful. It was bad strategy, but I don't think there's any evidence that Pringle himself was involved in this. "The Democrats will try and put glue on this issue and make it stick to (Pringle), but I think he'll be able to dodge it. . . . I don't see any candidates out there strong enough to knock off Pringle." "They can run poll guards, poll guards, poll guards, but I don't think it will be enough," Englander added. "People's memories, when it comes to political events, are quite short." Pringle, in a September, 1989, court deposition, said he had talked a few months before the election about having "poll watchers" to guard against rumored fraud by Democrats. But he said he did not know until Election Day that uniformed security guards were on hand. "In my opinion," Pringle said, "it was inappropriate to use uniformed security people in the polling places." Orange County prosecutors, working with federal law enforcement officials, are still investigating the possibility of criminal charges arising from the poll guards, Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade said Thursday. But even without criminal action, local Democrats say the combination of the $400,000 settlement and state legislation that arose from the incident, banning security guards near poll sites, are enough to hurt the Republicans. "This is over as far as the courtroom battle is concerned," said Santa Ana City Councilman Miguel A. Pulido, who is considering a run for Pringle's seat. "But it will be many, many years before the outrage in the community over this passes." State Assemblyman Richard Katz, a Democrat who helped in Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach's failed race against Pringle in 1988, added: "This one is going to be tough for the Republican Party in Orange County to shake." One person who some Democrats think could take advantage of that situation is Umberg, 34, who has concentrated largely on drug prosecutions in his more than two years as a federal prosecutor in Santa Ana. Umberg said Thursday that he could not comment on a possible run but acknowledged that "a number of people are encouraging me." And his name has been widely mentioned by Democrats in recent weeks as an attractive candidate. One potential liability mentioned by some Democrats and Republicans alike, however, may be the perception of Umberg as an outsider in the district. He had lived in Irvine but just recently moved to Garden Grove. "It's very commendable that he wants to run for office, but I think a candidate should live in a district for a while and know it well to represent it," said Westminster City Councilwoman Lyn Gillespie, a Democrat who said she herself has effectively ruled out a run for the seat. The sole announced candidate so far for the seat is Jerry Yudelson, a strong environmentalist who worked in Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s Administration and lost a bid for Congress in Orange County. Times staff writers Catherine Gewertz and Dave Lesher contributed to this story.

Title: U.S. UNIT YIELDS TO PIER PRESSURE; PRESERVATION: IT MAY BE HISTORIC, BUT HUNTINGTON BEACH HAS GOTTEN FEDERAL APPROVAL TO RAZE THE REMNANTS OF THE OLD PIER AND BUILD A NEW ONE.
Author: BILL BILLITER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: HUNTINGTON BEACH PIER; HISTORIC BUILDINGS; HUNTINGTON BEACH (CA) -- LANDMARKS; HUNTINGTON BEACH (CA) -- DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT; FUND RAISING; HUNTINGTON BEACH (CA) -- FINANCES
Text: To the relief of city officials, a federal agency has given its approval to plans to tear down the old city pier in order to build a new one. City Administrator Paul E. Cook said the federal green light means construction of the new pier can begin by early next summer. "We've cleared a hurdle," he said. "We were a little concerned that we'd have another agency to fight." Cook said the placement of the old pier on a list of federally protected historic sites had increased the city government's anxiety about getting permission to tear it down. A new pier, expected to cost about $11 million, could not be started until the fate of the old one was determined, Cook said. There has been statewide interest in Huntington Beach's pier situation, largely because the old structure -- which dates back to 1914 -- is one of the better known landmarks in Southern California. About 1.5 million tourists a year strolled the old pier before it was shut down for safety reasons about 1 1/2 years ago. Earlier this year -- and against the objections of the City Council -- the old, deteriorating pier was placed on the federal Register of Historic Places. Such a designation usually keeps an old building from being changed or destroyed. But engineers last summer unanimously recommended that the old pier be razed, saying it was not feasible to rebuild it. About 200 feet of the pier, including the restaurant at the end of the structure, was washed away in a violent storm Jan. 17 and 18, 1988. The rest of the pier was closed the following July because of its unsafe condition. The City Council's decision to raze the old pier and build a new one hinged on not running into federal opposition to tearing it down, Cook said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in a letter dated Dec. 5, notified the city that it has reviewed the pier situation and has no objection to the city's tearing down the old structure. "The city of Huntington Beach has considered all appropriate alternatives and has determined that the only feasible alternative is to demolish and reconstruct the pier. We have consulted with the state historic preservation officer and have determined that the proposed action is appropriate for the condition of the pier," the FEMA letter, signed by Tommie C. Hamner, chief of the agency's Disaster Assistance Program, stated. Cook said the only thing the city must do now is to "document the old pier through photos and measurements and put those documentations on record so that in case any historians want information for a book or something like that, the information will be available." Cook said the city also hopes to retain "a little bit of the old flavor of the old pier" in the construction of the new one. "We want some of the architecture to replicate features of the old pier," Cook said. Final architectural drawings for the new pier have not been completed. The architectural firm headed by Ron Yeo of Corona del Mar is in charge of designing both the pier and a proposed plaza on the beach end of the new pier. Preliminary drawings by Yeo's firm depict a new pier that will be 1,819 feet in length -- just a tad longer than the 1,800-foot old pier, which had been home to the newly renovated the End Cafe until the January, 1988, storm. Pat Marr, a member of the design team in Yeo's firm, said Thursday that the preliminary designs call for the new pier to have a diamond-shaped end. The diamond would surround an eight-sided restaurant building. "We decided on the octagonal design for historical reasons," said Marr. "Our research showed that the original building at the end of the pier was octagonal. It was called a 'sun room,' and it was built about 1930. Later it became a restaurant." The eight-sided restaurant also would allow maximum use of windows and thus give diners ample chance to view the ocean, Marr said. The diamond-shaped area surrounding the restaurant "will allow shuttles (vehicles) from the land to come out to the pier and turn around the restaurant easily," Marr said. The pier also will be designed with the ocean end higher than its beach end, the reverse of the earlier design, Marr said. Engineers have said that a major reason storms ripped away the end of the pier in both 1983 and 1988 was that the ocean end was so low in the water. Marr said that while the Yeo firm now only has "conceptual" architectural plans for the new pier, the general goal is to incorporate many historic features. "It (the new pier) will pretty much mimic the old pier," he said. Cook said that a stepped-up fund-raising campaign for the new pier will be launched in January. Cook said the city so far "has $6.5 million either in hand or promised." He said $3 million of that is pledged by the city, with the rest earmarked by the county, state and federal governments. A wide array of private fund raising also is in progress for the pier. But Cook said the January campaign will kick off concentrated efforts to obtain corporate donations. The city hopes to begin demolition of the old pier in May, and start on the new pier shortly afterward, with the goal of opening the new pier by Labor Day, 1991, Cook said.

Title: ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; KENNEDY WILL NOT RUN FOR REELECTION
Author: SHANNON SANDS
Abstract: TUSTIN (CA) -- ELECTIONS; TUSTIN (CA) -- GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS; POLITICAL CANDIDATES
Text: Councilwoman Ursula E. Kennedy announced Thursday that she does not plan to seek reelection. Kennedy's announcement leaves just one incumbent in the race, in which three City Council seats will be open. "I am not a career councilwoman, and I feel change is good," Kennedy said. "It is my hope that all three seats will be filled by newcomers." Kennedy, who was first elected to the council in 1978, said she had planned for this to be her last term when she was reelected in 1986 but had been reconsidering because of the divisive state of the council. "This last year has been the most exciting year of my life," said Kennedy, who was mayor until Nov. 20. "I had to keep the council from blowing up, and I think I did a commendable job. It was like having five sticks of dynamite at every meeting." Council members have been bitterly divided over such issues as abortion, flag-burning, newsstand bans and developer fees. Councilman John Kelly, who has been opposed to Kennedy on most issues, has announced that he will seek reelection. The election is scheduled for April, unless a judge on Jan. 17 invalidates the council's decision to move elections from November. The judge will also decide whether then-councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey was a legal resident of the city when he voted for the election change on Nov. 20. He has since given up his council seat because he moved from Tustin. SHANNON SANDS

Title: ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; BOY FACES ADDED COUNT IN MALL DEATH
Author: null
Abstract: MURDERS -- ORANGE COUNTY; SHOOTINGS -- ORANGE COUNTY; SHOOTING ACCIDENTS -- ORANGE COUNTY; GUNS; YOUTH; CARDENAS, JUAN MANUEL
Text: Prosecutors in the case of a 12-year-old boy accused of shooting to death a 12-year-old girl in a crowded Orange County mall last week amended the charges against the boy Thursday to include a misdemeanor count of exhibiting a firearm in a threatening manner. Juan Manuel Cardenas, who has already been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the shooting of Jacalyn Calabrese and assault with a deadly weapon for allegedly pointing a .25-caliber pistol at another girl, was charged with the misdemeanor count as a precaution, said Deputy Dist. Atty. John D. Conley. "We just want to make sure all the bases are covered," Conley said Thursday after a court appearance in Santa Ana at which the defense was granted a continuance. The trial is now scheduled to begin Feb. 5 instead of Jan. 10. Deputy Public Defender Chris Hilger said the additional count has a minimal effect on the case and will not cause him to alter his defense preparations. Witnesses said Cardenas had been showing off the pistol for several weeks before the Dec. 18 shooting of his middle-school classmate in the Mall of Orange. They also said he held the gun to the temple of another girl, Keli Edwards, as a joke just minutes before shooting Jacalyn, who dared him to pull the trigger, apparently because she thought the gun was fake. "The third count is a result of his pointing the firearm" at Keli Edwards, Conley said. The boy has pleaded not guilty to all counts, Conley said.

Author: null
Abstract: TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS -- ORANGE COUNTY
Text: A 21-year-old man was critically injured Thursday when he crashed his motor scooter into the rear of a truck on the Beach Boulevard overpass of the Santa Ana Freeway, Buena Park police said. The man's name was being withheld until his parents could be told, and police said they did not know where he lived. Police spokeswoman Betty Haney said the scooter rider, who was not wearing a helmet, was headed west when he struck the tractor-trailer shortly after 6 a.m. The man sustained massive head injuries in the crash, Haney said, and was unconscious when he was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange. The man apparently had been going too fast when he hit the truck, which was traveling between 15 and 20 m.p.h., police said. The driver of the truck was not cited.

Title: ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; STABLES NEAR BOLSA CHICA MUST CLOSE
Author: LORELEI LACHMAN
Abstract: LEASES; STABLES; HORSES; EVICTIONS; HUNTINGTON BEACH (CA) -- DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT; METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT
Text: Smoky's Stables, one of the few remaining horse stables in the area, soon will be just a little part of the city's history. The Metropolitan Water District, which owns the land, has terminated the stable's lease, leaving 150 horses without a home. The district is in negotiation with Signal Landmark in Irvine to develop 41.5 acres next to the Bolsa Chica Wetlands. But for stable owners Fred and Alexis Burkett, the news that they must vacate by the end of the year was sad. "We have the pony birthday parties," Alexis Burkett said. "Kids come down all dressed up as cowboys and they have their whole party here and they get to ride ponies. Once we are gone, they are going to have to go to Irvine Park -- that's the closest. It's just that here it's real convenient and it's a nice local thing to do." The Burketts claim they have two years left on their lease and they plan to fight the eviction. "I've never been so worried," Fred Burkett said. "I'm a fighter and I don't like losing. I'm determined I'm going to stay until it's over." Water district officials said a clause in the five-year lease agreement gives them the authority to abolish the remaining two years of the agreement with 60 days' notice. Russ Twomey, attorney for the district, declined to discuss plans for the property. Sue Vernand, 35, of Huntington Beach and her two daughters are worried about where their horse, Charlie, who lives at Smoky's Stables, will go now. "We were at Fox Meadows for 10 years and when we moved him it was pretty traumatic," she said. "He refused to eat." Vernand said she got a notice from the Burketts that told of the eviction notice. "They tried to get boarders to stick around at that time, but people started putting their names in other places," Vernand said. "We're not sure how serious the water department is. We're just waiting for the final ax to fall." LORELEI LACHMAN

Title: ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY BUCKLES DOWN ON SEAT BELT LAW
Author: CHRIS WOODYARD
Abstract: SEAT BELTS; CALIFORNIA -- LAWS; AUTOMOBILE SAFETY; HUNTINGTON BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT; HUNTINGTON BEACH (CA) -- TRANSPORTATION
Text: In an effort to persuade drivers to buckle up, Huntington Beach police plan to start a special enforcement program next week along Beach Boulevard. Officer Dave Humphreys said the city's team of motorcycle officers will post additional signs warning drivers that they are entering a special traffic law enforcement zone and advising them to make sure their seat belts are on. "We're pushing this whole concept throughout the department. We going to push this seat belt issue this whole year," Humphreys said. The traffic law enforcement team has operated for months primarily as an education tool to encourage motorists to slow down and drive more safely. While motorists are pulled over for even the slightest infractions, they are usually simply given warnings and a pamphlet. State law prevents police from stopping drivers because of a seat belt violation. But Humphreys said if the team's officers find unbuckled motorists who were stopped for other reasons, they most likely will be ticketed. The new seat belt program is scheduled to start Tuesday on Beach Boulevard between the San Diego Freeway and Warner Avenue. The zone will be posted with signs reading, "Seat Belt On?" and "Buckle Up!" First-time seat belt offenders must pay fines of $20 plus court costs. CHRIS WOODYARD

Title: ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; PARKING FEE NEEDS REVIEW
Author: null
Abstract: null
Text: San Juan Capistrano's decision to impose a $2-a-day parking fee for Amtrak commuters is shortsighted and could cost the city much more than it hopes to earn. In levying this local charge at the same time that the South Coast Air Quality Management District is working to bring the county into compliance with federal clean-air standards and transportation officials are promoting rail and bus commuting, San Juan Capistrano is ignoring its local responsibility. The city will pick up a few extra dollars, but San Juan Capistrano -- and the entire area -- will pay a heavy environmental cost for every commuter who goes back to the car and onto the freeway. For years the 99 parking spaces at the depot have been free to commuters. Starting Tuesday, those spaces will have a three-hour limit, and commuters will be forced to use one of the 131 parking places set aside in a new parking garage across from the depot. Those new parking spots carry a $2-a-day fee, a charge sure to have an adverse effect on commuter train travel. The use of the passenger trains running from San Diego to Los Angeles has been growing each year, until it is now one of the most heavily traveled rail corridors in the nation. San Juan Capistrano is a major station in the Amtrak system, in terms of passenger loads. And all county transportation plans that aim to get motorists out of their cars and into public transit rely heavily on the train as a workable alternative, with San Juan as a vital link in the rail park-and-ride system. Other county cities with stops along the line -- Santa Ana, Anaheim and Fullerton -- do not charge commuters for parking. San Juan Capistrano shouldn't, either. If it doesn't remove the fees entirely, it should at least sell monthly passes to keep them within reason.

Title: MIKE PENNER: IN THE INTERIM, DARNELL HAS FUN
Author: MIKE PENNER
Abstract: COACHES; FOOTBALL; UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA; DARNELL, GARY
Text: Being a licensed pilot, Gary Darnell quickly got over his fear of flying as emergency head coach for Florida's embattled football team. "It's like being up there in the X-15 every day," Darnell says. "We fly as fast and as high and as hard as we can. It's great when you've got all the systems going. You flick your wrist a little bit the wrong way and it could blow up." But that's part of the job, part of the thrill. "It's been fun flying in the left seat," he says. Too bad about the ejector button on the console that's about to be pushed. As he heads into Saturday's Freedom Bowl, Darnell has to feel a little like William Shatner in that "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" episode from "The Twilight Zone." What's that out on the wing? Oh my God, it's . . . Steve Spurrier. Spurrier is out there, all right, and that means Darnell may soon be out of there. Florida already has offered its head coaching job to Spurrier, the Gators' 1966 Heisman Trophy winner, a hero from better bygone days coming home to clean up the current mess. Spurrier, who currently coaches at Duke, has told some of his players and coaches that he won't be back next season -- and Darnell doesn't have to be told what that means. See ya later, interim Gator. "Yeah, that's the assumption," Darnell said Thursday at a Freedom Bowl media luncheon at the Disneyland Hotel. "I don't have any reason to think differently." And that doesn't bother Darnell? "I didn't go to the University of Florida to be a head coach," he said. "I pretty much assumed I'd be one sometime, someplace. "Then, all this happened this year and it became a matter of responsibility. Someone had to move in and take charge and pull things together." Darnell was just another assistant coach, specializing in inside linebackers and down-home yarns, when, on Oct. 8, Galen Hall was forced to resign amid allegations of making illegal payments to players and coaches. Threats of NCAA probation loomed over the Gators' heads. Florida needed someone to start bailing and Darnell was the one handed the bucket. Darnell finished out the season, coaching the InvestiGators to a 3-3 record in their last six games. The losses? To No. 5-ranked Florida State (24-17), to No. 9 Auburn (10-7) and to Georgia (17-10). Not bad, considering that in the interim, Darnell lost his starting quarterback (charge: betting on college football games) and his starting defensive tackle (charge: sexual assault) to various crimes and misdemeanors. At Florida, as Darnell has learned, there's always something. "Besides being a head coach here, you have to deal with so many other things," he said. "There's a uniqueness about Florida. You're never handling a situation that's routine. And if there was ever an interview under fire (that had to be done), I did it." If the Gators are unique, and that's one way of putting it, Darnell was the right man for the job. Reared in the nooks and crannies of Oklahoma and Arkansas, the 40-year-old most definitely has his own way of looking at things. When the heat was first starting to come down on Florida, first with the loss of Hall and then with the suspension of quarterback Kyle Morris, Darnell studied the facts and drawled, "Daddy got drunk and went to jail. . . . Now it's time for the family to pull together and help each other out." When the Florida athletic department announced it was beginning a national search for Hall's replacement, Darnell said he was glad. "The best thing about that is, I'm in the nation," he mused. Darnell also has these theories. For one, he believes his Florida players are biologically different than the Washington Huskies that will line up against them Saturday. "It's because of our heat factor," he says. "Because we're constantly exposed to the heat, our bodies' compositions are different. "If you're in a cooler climate, the body naturally pads itself against it. We played in 110 degrees against the University of Miami. If it gets below 50 (degrees), our players get worried." He also believes that intense football, really intense football, can be played for only short periods of time. "It's like Atlas," he said, referring to the mythological titan who was assigned to supporting the planet Earth on his shoulders. "You hold that thing that long, you're gonna get tired." Darnell knows about intensity. In his words, Gator football attracts "the most intense media scrutiny in the state of Florida. We have the second-highest request for press credentials in the country. Notre Dame is No. 1. . . . We're the largest sporting event in Florida, bigger than the Dolphins, bigger than Tampa Bay. No one gets the exposure we get." Getting used to it was more difficult than getting to the Freedom Bowl. But Darnell's a quick study. Still publicly undecided about his starting quarterback this weekend, Darnell squirmed free from several questions about the matter before someone Thursday asked him, "OK, who's going to be your backup quarterback?" Darnell grinned across the dais and said, "See what I mean? I get this five days a week." Then, without missing another beat, Darnell playfully shot back his answer: "The guy who I don't decide to start." It could be worse, Darnell reckons. "I've been treated really good," he says. "The media, the fans, the administrations -- they've almost been too kind. If I was the regular guy and I lost to Georgia, I'd be blistered. But I wasn't. There's a small amount of compassion allowed for that." As a coach, Darnell describes himself as "just a good organizer." And as a pilot? "Oh," he says with a smile, "you wouldn't want to get in an airplane with me." Funny, but with Darnell at the controls, the flight at Florida has been about as smooth as it ever gets down there.

Title: FREEDOM BOWL NOTEBOOK; BATTLE LINES ARE DRAWN BY CONTRASTING OFFENSES
Author: HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA; FREEDOM BOWL (FOOTBALL GAME); UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON; FOOTBALL PLAYERS
Text: As Southerners see it, the West is still wild -- at least when it comes to the explosive passing game favored by colleges on this side of the Rockies. North of the Mason-Dixon line, the ground-based game favored by so many Southern teams is as strange as grits for breakfast. The rules are the same, but the flavor is distinctly different in the Southeastern and Pacific 10 conferences. Florida's running game and Washington's passing attack, typical of the styles of their respective regions, led the coaches of both schools to discuss the contrast that's sure to develop in the Freedom Bowl Saturday at Anaheim Stadium. Of the Gators' 4,321 net yards, 2,693 (62.3%) were gained by rushing and 1,628 (37.7%) by passing. But rushing accounted for only 1,383 of the Huskies' 4,009 net yards (34.5%) and passing plays accounted for the remaining 2,626 yards, or 65.5%. The Gators would lead the Pac-10 in rushing but would rank ninth in passing. "I think there is a West Coast style of football, just as there is a Southern style," said Gary Darnell, Florida interim coach. "It's just a feeling on my part that the ball is thrown more in that part of the country. There's passing leagues in the summertime and the ball just gets thrown more. In our part of the country, the running game and the option game are more prevalent than in that part of the country." Washington Coach Don James agreed with Darnell, but said such trends go in cycles. "When I left the South, there were some pretty good passers," said James, who was an assistant coach at Florida State from 1959 through 1963. "Joe Namath was at Alabama and Steve Spurrier was a pretty good quarterback (for Florida)." James used a familiar frame of reference -- the Pac-10 -- to express his admiration for the Gators' defensive unit. "USC is the best defense we played against, and they're the equal of the SC defense," James said. Washington lost to USC, 24-16, on Oct. 7. Florida's defense allowed 241.9 yards per game, best in the SEC and third in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rankings. The Gators' rushing defense allowed 88.6 yards per game, fifth-best in the NCAA and the best in the SEC, and their passing defense ranked third in the conference and eighth in the NCAA at an average of 153.3 yards per game. In scoring defense, the Gators ranked second in the SEC and 13th in the NCAA, with an average of 15.3 points per game. Washington allowed opponents an average of 137.6 yards rushing per game, fifth in the Pac-10, and 216.5 yards passing. The Huskies were fourth in total defense, allowing an average of 354.1 yards per game. No matter the outcome Saturday, James figures he can't lose on this trip. The possibility of inclement weather in Seattle convinced the Huskies to come to Southern California to practice on Dec. 18, and James has used much of the time here to visit prospective recruits. "We've had some players come to practices," said James, whose team found a home away from home at Golden West College in Huntington Beach. "A victory in the bowl game would be like icing on the cake. We've already got the cake. I don't think a defeat is going to determine how many players we're going to get." Several players stand to gain considerably with solid performances Saturday. Foremost is Florida tailback Emmitt Smith, who has said he would turn pro if the Gators had a new coach next season and he had to learn a fourth offensive system in four years. However, Smith maintained that he isn't using this game to enhance his NFL prospects. "I don't look at this as a big showcase for Emmitt Smith," said Smith, whose 1,599 yards was third-best in the NCAA this season. "I look at this game as an opportunity for the University of Florida to better our 7-4 season and perhaps go 8-4. That would be the best season since the 9-1-1 seasons (in 1984 and '85) and that would be very good for recruiting." For Husky defensive end Dennis Brown, the game is one of his final chances to impress pro scouts. Brown, one of two Washington defensive captains, graduated from Long Beach Jordan High. He also will play in the East-West Shrine Game. "It feels good to come home and play my final game as a Husky here," he said.

Title: HE JUST WANTS TO STAY IN GAME; HOLIDAY BOWL: FRED WHITTINGHAM JR., SIDELINED BY SEVERE HEADACHES AT EL MODENA, BECOMES A FIXTURE IN BYU'S BACKFIELD.
Author: MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: SPORTS INJURIES; FOOTBALL PLAYERS; WHITTINGHAM, FRED JR; BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY
Text: It's fitting that Fred Whittingham Jr. has played most of this college football season for Brigham Young with a broken bone in each wrist. That's the type of football player he is. As a senior at El Modena High School, Whittingham proved just how difficult it is to keep him away from the sport. He was hospitalized because of severe headaches after a football game in October. The headaches were determined to be caused by internal bleeding in his brain, and doctors recommended that he not play the rest of the season. Some doctors said he shouldn't play football again. Although he wasn't able to play for El Modena again, he did play in college. Now Whittingham is the starting fullback for BYU (10-2), which will meet Penn State (7-3-1) in the Holiday Bowl tonight at 5 in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. He has been the Cougars' leading rusher for the past three seasons and is one of two lettermen remaining from the 1984 team that defeated Michigan in the Holiday Bowl and won the national championship. A psychology major with a 3.24 grade-point average, Whittingham is an academic all-American. Whittingham, son of Ram linebacker coach Fred Whittingham, isn't an especially fast runner, and at 5-feet-9 and 200 pounds, he doesn't have the ideal body for a fullback. "He's just not quite as tall or as big as other people but he's big enough," BYU Coach LaVell Edwards said. He's tough enough, too. As a child, he would stare down other children just to see what they would do. Consequently, he got in a lot of fights. "I kind of grew out of wanting to fight," Whittingham said, "But I guess it stuck with me on the field. Not the fighting but the competitiveness." Whittingham broke a bone in each wrist in successive games early this season. Despite the pain, he had his wrists wrapped, continued to play and avoided having the injuries X-rayed until about a month later. "All (the X-rays) would have told me was whether they were broken or not," Whittingham said, "and I really didn't want to know because if they were broken I would have played anyway." Whittingham doesn't volunteer information about injuries. "I try to stay away from doctors," he said. During his senior year at El Modena, five doctors told him he shouldn't play football again. Blood was found in his spinal fluid, indicating that the severe headaches he was suffering were caused by hemorrhages in his brain. The headaches had started in early October after a game. They were persistent but not especially severe. Still, they were bad enough that Whittingham went to a doctor, who could find nothing wrong. But after the next game, in which he took a couple of hard hits, the headaches became severe on the bus ride home. "He really got ripped several times, but that was the kind of ballcarrier he was," said Bob Lester, his coach at El Modena. "He charged headlong into everything." His mother, Nancy, said Fred came home, said the pain was worse, then fell asleep. When he woke up, Nancy said, "I think he kind of had tears in his eyes; (he said), 'I don't know what I'm going to do. This is hurting so much.' " That night, his parents took him to St. Joseph Hospital on Orange for tests. The next day, he checked into Anaheim Memorial Hospital where the tests continued. His head was X-rayed from all angles but the doctors could not find the cause of the headaches. One neurologist suggested that he quit football. Another said it might be migraine headaches. "It was kind of frustrating to know that my head hurt that bad, yet all those tests were coming up negative," Whittingham said. Finally, Whitting ham was given a spinal tap, which showed that there had been internal bleeding. The doctor told him to forget about football for at least the season. Despite this advice, Whittingham got antsy when the headaches subsided a few weeks later. His team was driving toward the Southern Section playoffs and he wanted to play. He was allowed to practice before the first week of the playoffs. But the headaches started to come back, and although they were mild, it was decided that he wouldn't play. He did play a month and a half later when El Modena defeated Foothill, 10-7, in a Southern Section championship game at Anaheim Stadium. He was in for only one play, as a decoy. It was meant to be a tribute to Whittingham. Lester said Whittingham was in no danger. "I was more frustrated to be in a uniform and not be able to play," Whittingham said. "I almost wished I just dressed in street clothes." Because the injury kept Whittingham out of almost half of his senior season, almost all of the coaches who had been recruiting him backed off. But not Edwards. The Edwards and Whittingham families had been neighbors in Provo, Utah, when Fred Sr. was a BYU assistant. "They really do watch that closely and they can tell the difference between something that is a real problem and something that will pass by," Edwards said. "If he were to have come in complaining of headaches, that would have been picked up in a hurry." Edwards said that although Fred didn't get a scholarship because he was a Whittingham, the name certainly helped. "There's something to be said for genes and competitiveness," Edwards said. Nancy Whittingham tried to make it to every BYU home game during the 1984 season to watch Fred Jr. and another son, Cary, a senior linebacker. She said she was worried every time Fred Jr. carried the ball. "I just kept watching him every second after the play," Nancy Whittingham said. "I kept watching the sideline, watching for any movement that might tell me something." Whittingham had only 25 carries in his freshman year. But he did get hit in practice, harder than he was hit in high school. But the headaches never returned. "When I was getting hit as hard as I had in my whole life and my head didn't hurt, I thought it was probably OK," Whittingham said. Although Whittingham had been given clearance to play by a neurologist at UCLA, he received no guarantees. "(Other doctors) just figured that any kind of a head injury wasn't worth the risk," Nancy said. "That doesn't take into account how badly the individual wants to play." He certainly wants to play. Older brothers Kyle and Cary played linebacker for BYU, and both played for the Rams as replacements during the NFL strike in 1987. His father played linebacker for BYU and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and for the Rams, Eagles, Saints and Cowboys. "If the tests had showed anything at all, we would have stopped him from playing," his father said. "It does put a little bit of a scare in you, but that's part of anything in life." Whittingham took two seasons off on a mission for the Mormon church in southern Florida, and when he returned before the 1987 season, he became the starting fullback. Whittingham's single-game high this season has been 81 yards. Only once at BYU has he rushed for more than 100 yards. But despite averaging only about 10 carries a game, he led the Cougars in rushing each year that he started. "For our kind of offense, he fits right in," Edwards said, "he's an excellent blocker, ballcarrier and pass receiver." But it's carrying the ball that Whittingham enjoys most. When he does get hold of the ball, he doesn't think of sparing his body. "That's just the way I am out there. I could probably minimize the abuse I take, but that's not the style I play," Whittingham said.

Title: ORANGE TOURNAMENT; MATER DEI TAKES CARE OF PARKS AND MARINA
Author: TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: null
Text: Mater Dei High School's defense was more than even Marina's talented center, Cherokee Parks, could handle Thursday night in the semifinals of the 25th Orange Holiday Tournament at Chapman College's Hutton Sports Center. Mater Dei limited Parks to only 10 shots and utilized a half-court trap that was responsible for 25 turnovers in a 71-54 victory to advance to the championship game for the seventh time in the past eight years. Mater Dei (11-1) meets Saddleback in the final, marking the third time the teams have played in a tournament championship in the past two years. Saddleback defeated Mater Dei in the finals of Orange and Newport-Costa Mesa tournaments last year. Parks scored 17 points, had seven rebounds and blocked four shots but wasn't a factor against a tall and physical team. Mater Dei took a 10-point lead in the third quarter when Charles Andres completed a three-point play and then turned it on in the final quarter. "We didn't handle their press and let the pressure get to us," said Steve Popovich, Marina coach. "They're so physical, they just pound you with size and strength." Parks, a 6-foot-11 junior, was hounded by Andres and Andy Karich most of the night. He made six of 10 shots and worked hard for all of his points. Marina had problems getting the ball inside to Parks in the first half, committing 17 turnovers. Marina had 11 turnovers in the first quarter alone, but the Vikings only trailed, 30-24, at halftime. Marina (8-5) did have some success with outside shooting provided by guard Travis Boyd, but the Vikings usually got only one shot with Mater Dei controlling the boards. Mater Dei took the biggest lead of the half, 29-22, when guard Jason Quinn made a free throw following a steal. But the Monarchs were cold in the first half, making only 10 of 33 shots. Marina forward Brent Shelor, who scored 24 points on Wednesday night against El Toro, finished with only 10 points. In another game: Saddleback 53, Dominguez 41 -- In a game short on points and long on defense, Saddleback forced 18 turnovers and limited Dominguez to just 19 of 47 shots in advancing to the championship game for the third consecutive year. Saddleback (10-4) never trailed and opened a 20-point lead early in the fourth quarter. Dominguez (10-2) finally got untracked midway through the fourth quarter when reserve Greg Lacy made a pair of three-point shots. Guard Andre McFarlane led Saddleback with 15 points and center Marco Gomez had 12 rebounds.

Title: MAN WHO SAYS BANK OWES HIM TIES UP ITS REAL ESTATE
Author: MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: SUITS; HAYS, TED; WELLS FARGO BANK; LIENS; LOANS; REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT
Text: A former Orange County real estate agent has tied up Wells Fargo's real estate holdings in California in a legal ploy to get the big bank to pay him a $700,000 judgment. Ted Hays, 78, was in a hospital with cancer in 1984 when Wells Fargo "mistakenly" paid a $1.5-million loan that Hays had arranged to two of his business associates, according to a civil suit Hays filed in Los Angeles. The loan was needed to build a small housing project in Orange. The two business associates expected Hays to die, according to his lawyer, Robert C. Aronoff, and never gave him $440,000, his share of the loan. A Los Angeles Superior Court jury in September awarded Hays $700,000. Wells Fargo said it would appeal the decision but cited federal court cases in declining to post a bond while it appealed. National banks, Wells Fargo contended, are not obligated under those court cases to post bonds while appealing lawsuits. Defendants in California courts are ordinarily required to post a bond equal to up to 1 1/2 times the amount of the judgment when they appeal a case. That's to ensure that they will pay if they lose on appeal. Hays' lawyer then asked the trial judge to place liens on Wells Fargo's real estate, which the judge did Wednesday. The liens -- a type of legal obligation -- make it virtually impossible for the bank to sell property because a buyer would be stuck with the obligation to pay the judgment. The liens cover property Wells Fargo owns throughout the state, including parcels in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Wells Fargo said it would go to federal court today to ask that the liens be removed. Should that fail, a Wells Fargo lawyer said, the bank will appeal to a state court and ultimately will post a bond if the appeal is rejected by the courts. "This is simply a tactical maneuver by Mr. Hays," said William Reichert, bank senior counsel. Hays, who says he is bedridden, was a real estate agent in Orange and Riverside counties in 1984 when he brought in the two associates to help him build homes on more than 20 acres in the city of Orange. Hays, who lives in Murrieta Hot Springs in Riverside County, planned to promote the neighborhood as a sports-oriented community. He lined up Mel Renfro -- a former Dallas Cowboys football player -- and other pro footballers to buy lots in the neighborhood. Hays arranged to borrow $1.5 million on the property from Wells Fargo to build the houses. But then he went in the hospital, and when he came out, the property was in foreclosure for failure to make payments on the loan. It was later sold.

Title: FILM IN THE EIGHTIES; FOR LOVERS OF FILM, A DECADE OF LITTLE HOPE AND LESS GLORY
Author: SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC
Abstract: 1980S (DECADE); MOTION PICTURES
Text: Backward glances are obligatory at this time of year, especially when we close out a decade, but this has not been a decade of movie memories to look back on with much more than growing hopelessness. No wonder. What appeared on American movie screens reflected the country's own dubious morality: the withering of its social conscience, its feel-good, guiltless preoccupation with surfaces, with dumb fun, with violence and rampant acquisitiveness. This has been the decade in which our big moneymakers included "Porky's," "Police Academy," "Flashdance," "Rocky III" and "Cocktail," and their profits blazed the trail for countless clones. If the titles of the dozens of movies about adolescent boys trying to score are missing, it's only because after the 20th example, the mind is capable of rejecting an entire subset. A few directors tried to make contemporary morality their point: David Lynch with "Blue Velvet," Woody Allen with "Crimes and Misdemeanors," Oliver Stone with "Wall Street." But you have to wonder, how many people found Gordon Gekko repulsive and how many daydreamed about being him? What's a little moral vacuum in the Ronald Reagan-Ollie North decade? Directors themselves were not having an easy time of it during this era. Major film makers of the '70s or before -- among them Arthur Penn, Sidney Lumet, Michael Ritchie, Hal Ashby, John Frankenheimer and Costa-Gavras -- turned before our eyes from directors of urgency to directors for hire. And we were the losers. As power shifted from directors and writer-directors to agents, producers and, if you can bear to think about it, development executives, we lived to see almost every worst-case scenario prosper. Not only prosper but become unwritten law: the necessary bankable actor, the packaged cast, the tyranny of the first-weekend's grosses. A film's worth is now measured entirely by its receipts, not just a nice profit -- which is not unreasonable -- but a sprawling, outrageous one, which is becoming mandatory. An offbeat story idea has to make back its costs tenfold, beginning with that blockbuster weekend; if not, that's held as proof of its essential worthlessness. Fortunately, "sex, lies, and videotape" didn't cost that much to begin with. The 1980s has been the decade in which the independent voice sang purely and strongly, and then very nearly petered out. Consider that banner year of '86, in which we had "Room With a View," "Smooth Talk," "Down by Law," "Platoon," "My Beautiful Laundrette," "Vagabond," and "Mona Lisa." Just now, as we round the end of the '80s, there is a sign that the spark has not been entirely lost: "My Left Foot," "High Hopes," "True Love," "Powwow Highway," "Some Girls," "Henry V," "Distant Voices, Still Lives," "Mystery Train" and "Drugstore Cowboy" were enough to warm your hands over and feel immensely cheered about. This overview is not a way to end a last look, however, unless one plans to go straight to the top of the Black Tower and jump. Let's try one last hurrah for what was brave and beautiful about the '80s. There were the inward looks: "Ordinary People," "Accidental Tourist," "Tender Mercies," "Terms of Endearment," "My Life as a Dog," "The Makioka Sisters," and in its own way, "Dead Ringers." There was a resurgence of the kind of spectacle that only the movie screen does justice to: "The Last Emperor," "Ran," "Hope and Glory," "The Killing Fields," "Chariots of Fire," "Reds," "Year of the Dragon," "Once Upon a Time in America," "The Emerald Forest," "Little Dorrit," "Gandhi," "Red Sorghum," "The Right Stuff," "The Mission" and the restored "Lawrence of Arabia." If you think you've seen any of these because you watched them on video, you have yet to see them. There was, for want of a better description, the exquisite small-scale film: "The Dead," "The Moderns," "Stevie," "Testament," "Tin Men," "Barfly," "Smash Palace," "Choose Me," "Malcolm," "Bagdad Cafe," "The Shooting Party," "Housekeeping," Lizzie Borden's "Working Girls," "Pixote," "A Sunday in the Country," "Dance With a Stranger," "Baby, It's You," "Diner" and "My Dinner With Andre." There were outstanding documentaries: "Shoah," "Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," "George Stevens: A Filmmaker's Journey," "Streetwise," "The Times of Harvey Milk" and "Hail, Hail Rock 'n' Roll." There was the swoony, no-fooling love story: "The French Lieutenant's Woman," "Roxanne," "Moonstruck," "Out of Africa" and, if you're willing to lump in obsessive love, "Betty Blue." And there was a nice, healthy amount of comedy: "Arthur," "Splash," "Melvin and Howard," "Ishtar," "Married to the Mob," "Come Back to the 5 and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean," "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," "King of Comedy," "Airplane!," "Brazil," "Punchline," "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai," "Working Girl," "Breaking In," "Monty Python's Meaning of Life," "Radio Days," "Zelig," "Purple Rose of Cairo," "Broadway Danny Rose" and Woody Allen's third of "New York Stories." There, that feels a little better now, doesn't it? RELATED STORIES: F6, F14

Title: FILM IN THE EIGHTIES; RAIDERS OF THE LOST ART; COLORIZATION, KID STUFF, CORPORATE TAKEOVERS: A DECADE WHEN OLD WAYS OF MAKING MOVIES DIED
Author: JACK MATHEWS, TIMES FILM EDITOR
Abstract: 1980S (DECADE); MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY -- LOS ANGELES; MOTION PICTURES; MOTION PICTURE STUDIOS; MOTION PICTURE PRODUCERS; MOTION PICTURE DIRECTORS; MOTION PICTURE AUDIENCES; TRENDS; EISNER, MICHAEL D; SPIELBERG, STEVEN; VIDEO INDUSTRY; VIDEO RECORDINGS
Text: Which image best symbolizes Hollywood in the 1980s? The memory nominates several candidates: The bug-eyed latex runt that Steven Spielberg turned into a lovable alien pup in "E.T.," the decade's greatest enchantment and the industry's greatest box-office performer. Francis Ford Coppola, the Wunderkind director of the 1970s, standing humbly in the midst of his neon-washed Las Vegas set for "One From the Heart," telling a few hundred hastily gathered reporters that his great experiment -- Zoetrope Studios -- was on the brink of bankruptcy. Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains looking spiffy in their computer-dyed dinner suits in the colorized "Casablanca," a version of the black-and-white classic that turned seedy Morocco into Mardi Gras and made us wish Ilsa had been played by Carmen Miranda. Pope John Paul II reminding an audience of Hollywood leaders of their their moral responsibilities in the world at the precise moment when some of them were busy running David Puttnam -- the only studio chief to have actually raised a moral issue during the decade -- out of town. Any scene from "Leonard Part VI," arguably the worst major-studio movie ever made, which was only made because its creator and star -- comedian and regional Coca-Cola bottler Bill Cosby -- was important to Coke-owned Columbia Pictures. Snow White bopping with home-video buff Rob Lowe in the desperate opening number of this year's Oscar telecast, and the subsequent legal hoohaw when Disney threatened to sue the embarrassed Motion Picture Academy for copyright infringement. Zsa Zsa Gabor, the septuagenarian poster girl for graceless aging, hiking her skirt for the cameras during her trial for smacking an uppity Beverly Hills cop, and the subsequent announcement that she'll be getting her own TV show next year. While all of these things say something about the decade and the business, none captures its essence quite as well as that of a toothless Leo the Lion being driven from his Culver City lair where, during Hollywood's Golden Age, he reigned over the shiniest kingdom of them all. Leo didn't roar during the '80s. He was knocked out and vivisected by the financial Frankenstein, Kirk Kerkorian, then sold off, organ by organ, to the highest bidders. During the decade, the home of Andy Hardy and Dorothy Gale was variously owned by MGM/UA, Ted Turner, Lorimar Telepictures and Warner Bros., and is about to become the home of Sony subsidiary Columbia Pictures. When Turner bought MGM, he made a rousing speech to the studio's employees about restoring the studio to its previous greatness and revealed that the effect of "Gone With the Wind" had been so great on him that he stuck a son with the name Rhett. Before the staff's eyes were dry, Turner had sold the lot to Lorimar Telepictures and made off with his real prize, the MGM library, which contained all those great black-and-white classics. "I think they look better in color, pal, and they're my movies," said Turner, on one of the many occasions when he told critics of colorization to lump it. The greed that governed Hollywood in the '80s was not mitigated by many great movies. The last American masterpiece, according to no less an authority than Steven Spielberg, was "The Godfather Part II," released 15 years ago. Spielberg himself shares the blame for the intellectual slump in film production. He and George Lucas, starting in the mid-70s, were so skillful at reviving the childhood thrill of the matinee adventure that they encouraged a decade of bad imitations and convinced Hollywood decision makers that the only audience worth wooing was the one in puberty. The '80s in Hollywood were dedicated to people with the ability to count to $200 million. Blockbuster fever, the three-year flu contracted by every new major-studio head, resulted in a rash of big, wart-like celluloid bumps. "Raise the Titanic" cost more than $40 million to make, grossed less than $7 million at the box office, and had the band playing "Nearer My God to Thee" on the stern of Lew Grade's Rank Organization. "Ishtar," a buddy road comedy commissioned by Columbia's Guy McElwaine, was the decade's quintessential major-studio misstep. The film teamed three of the best known high-salaried perfectionists in the business -- $5-million actors Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman and $2-million writer-director Elaine May. The announcement that Columbia was making something called "Ishtar" in North Africa with Beatty, Hoffman and May struck some people as the financial equivalent of sticking your hand in a running Cuisinart, and the skepticism was warranted. "Ishtar" went over schedule, over budget, missed its Christmas release date by five months and grossed a fraction of a budget estimated to have come in north of $50 million. "Ishtar" was not the worst big-budget movie of the '80s, or close to it. Nor was Michael Cimino's "Heaven's Gate," the runaway Western that brought ruin to United Artists and gave UA production chief Steven Bach the rare opportunity to exploit his own incompetence. (Bach wrote the best-selling book "Final Cut," explaining how he let Cimino overshoot his budget by $30 million.) The worst big-budget movie of the '80s was Columbia's "Leonard Part VI," a spy fantasy in which retired sleuth Bill Cosby outwitted some mad farm animals who were threatening to steal government secrets. Do you suppose this one looked good on paper? Cosby, who came up with the concept and produced the film, added a bizarre marketing footnote to the whole saga when he went on national TV just days before the movie opened and advised people to stay away. Among the other excesses of the '80s were these truly awful movies: "Rhinestone," a romantic comedy starring Sylvester Stallone as a goofy New York cab driver (so far, so good) who falls in love with Dolly Parton (whoops) and ends up winning a country-Western singing contest (yikes). Stallone did his own singing. "Can't Stop the Music," Allan Carr's 1980 Village People musical extravaganza, co-starred Olympic decathlon champ Bruce Jenner and was directed by Nancy Walker, who did better work in the decade portraying the paper-towel savant Rosie on those absorbing Bounty TV commercials. And "Howard the Duck," a movie of such waddling ineptitude that the title became an instant reference for other failures. (Universal had barely recovered from the "Howard" disgrace when critics began dubbing the studio's third "Jaws" sequel "Jaws the Duck.") The blockbuster mentality bred a revolving-door system of studio management, with insecure chief executives trying to hustle up megahits before their three-year contracts were half up. Scripts were developed by a new generation of production executives, baby boomers raised on laugh-track sitcoms and disease-of-the-week TV movies. To them, a social conscience meant watching "Saturday Night Live," a show that has indirectly led to more bad big-screen performances than the Ziegfeld Follies (thanks, guys, for Bill Murray in "The Razor's Edge"). Overall, the decade was a black hole for serious film makers. Deals made by one studio chief were routinely scuttled by the next. Films started under one executive were completed under another and shipped off to regional-release hell. ("Sorry, we opened it in Tupelo and nobody wanted to see it.") The studios that dominated the marketplace, not surprisingly, produced the decade's star executives. Michael Eisner and Barry Diller had a good run at Paramount, then went off to other glories -- Eisner to work his own magic over Disney's kingdom, Diller to run Fox for Rupert Murdoch. Eisner brought Jeffrey Katzenberg along from Paramount to chair the studio's production operations, and though few films of greatness emerged, Disney went from a virtual non-player to a position of leadership almost overnight. At the beginning of the decade, Disney's animation department was almost moribund, and the studio leaders couldn't bring themselves to make mainstream movies with violence and dirty words, even though they had created Touchstone Films with that in mind. Eisner and Katzenberg had no such reluctance, and when Bette Midler hit a high C with the decade's noisiest big-screen orgasm in "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," it was clear that a new day had dawned on Dopey Drive. If Eisner was chief executive of the decade, Steven Spielberg was the top producer. Spreading his creative pollen over several studios, Spielberg produced five of the decade's 10 highest-grossing pictures; three for Paramount (the "Raiders" trilogy) and two for Universal ("E.T." and "Back to the Future"). He also produced several pictures for Warner Bros., including the hits "The Color Purple" and "Gremlins." Spielberg directed most of those films, as well, and was inadvertently caught up in the decade's biggest Oscar controversy. Although he won the Directors Guild of America award for "The Color Purple" in 1986, he didn't even get a nomination from the directors branch of the academy. The film, meanwhile, received 11 Oscar nominations, including one for best picture. The Academy Awards show suffered a Nielsen ratings slump in the '80s, partly because of the general audience fragmentation due to the advent of cable and home video. But the event continued to be criticized for the bloat of its antiquated variety-show format, a flaw magnified by the academy's decision to shift venues from the relatively cozy Pavilion to the cavernous 6,000-seat Shrine Auditorium. Massive traffic jams got the first Shrine Oscar show off to a dismal start in 1988 and this year's telecast, produced by Allan Carr, prompted an ad hoc group of high-profile industry people to write a letter to Academy president Richard Kahn complaining that the event had been a professional embarrassment. Hey, the decade was a professional embarrassment. Next March, the Oscars move back to the Pavilion. Despite the poor overall quality of movies, the business entered a new boom period. The home-video industry, far from the threat it was perceived to be by studio chiefs in the late '70s, actually promoted moviegoing. The convenience of video rentals created a renewed interest in movies among older viewers and broadened the horizons, if not the tastes, of younger ones. The audience demographics changed dramatically from one end of the decade to the other. It began with kids going one way and their parents another; it ended in a frenzy of familial togetherness. Family movies are back. Box-office figures are always distorted, and in the current self-congratulatory orgy over toppling records, it is worth noting that most of the records were brought on by rising ticket prices. The average cost of a ticket rose from $2.69 in 1980 to about $4.40 at the end of 1989. That is a 65% increase in prices, compared to about a 10% increase in actual admissions. In terms of real movie watching, however, the decade saw enormous change. The sales and rentals of videocassette movies, a business that didn't exist barely 10 years ago, surpassed theatrical revenues in the mid-'80s. When all the math is in for 1989, the video industry is expected to outgross the theatrical playoff of movies by $11 billion to $5 billion. When you combine the two movie-driven businesses, and take into account the erosion in prime-time network TV viewing, the motion-picture industry appears stronger than at anytime since the late '40s. One thing that the mammoth video revolution proved was that nobody knows how big the next revolution will be. The long writers strike of 1988 -- which, in part, was about Hollywood's future -- confused members of the guild and the public, who had trouble understanding the victories claimed by both sides. Clearly, management and the industry guilds are jockeying for shares in future revenues from ancillary markets. There was certainly no revolution regarding women and minorities in film during the '80s. Amy Heckerling ends the decade on a high note, having scored a $100-million hit with her thinking-baby comedy "Look Who's Talking." But the number of women who directed major-studio movies was fewer than a dozen, and the number of black directors -- of either sex -- totaled even less. Dawn Steel, at Columbia, was the only woman to run a studio; no black did. Entering the last decade of its first century, Hollywood has some serious issues to address. At the top of the list is the inevitable globalization of its resources and outlook. With everything that's imminent -- the social and cultural waves that will sweep over the world from Eastern Europe and from the Pacific -- who is going to set Hollywood's agenda? During the '80s, the creative voices were mostly stilled. The power shifted from studio heads to agents and producers, squeezing all but the most facile writers and directors out and creating an environment where deals were more important than films. Flying in the face of global trends and migration patterns, even those in its own community, Hollywood became more insular than ever. Once a window opening onto the world, it is now more a window opening onto "Saturday Night Live." Despite an occasional "Gandhi" or "The Last Emperor," both of which were made outside the major-studio system, few films with worldly themes were made. The farther American film makers went, the closer to home they got. The outer-space adventure "Outland" was a virtual remake of "High Noon," with the Frontier Ethic in full bloom. The "Star Wars" films were also reset Westerns; the "Star Trek" films were U.S. TV reunions. "E.T." was "Lassie Come Home." For the moment, the rest of the world still looks upon Hollywood as the capital of invention, but it is an appreciation of style rather than of substance. In some ways, Hollywood enters the '90s where Detroit entered the '70s: full of self-confidence and commitments to short-term goals and domestic impulses. Soon, we'll learn whether the industry will change its outlook or, like some gas-guzzling, 4,000-pound Detroit sedan, get blown off the road.

Title: MORNING REPORT: POP LP CHART; RECORD BUYERS TAKING COLLINS' 'SERIOUSLY'
Author: DENNIS HUNT , Arts and entertainment reports from The Times, national and international news services and the nation's press.
Abstract: null
Text: It used to be rare that an artist topped Billboard pop album and singles charts simultaneously. This year, though, it's been fairly commonplace. The latest dual chart-topper is Phil Collins, with his ". . . But Seriously" album and his single, "Another Day in Paradise." Whitesnake's album "Slip of the Tongue" (No. 14) -- so far a disappointment -- is about to slip down the chart after just six weeks. A hit single, though, could still salvage the album. The two fastest-rising new albums are Bobby Brown's "Dance . . . Ya Know it!" (No. 18) and Quincy Jones' "Back on the Block" (No. 22). * With the 1 million-selling album "New Kids on the Block" moving up three rungs to No. 25, the remarkable teen vocal group New Kids has three albums in the Top 25, including two in the Top 10 -- "Hangin' Tough" (No. 6) and "Merry Merry Christmas" (No. 10). "Hangin' Tough" has topped 6 million while "Merry Merry Christmas" crossed the 2-million mark, a phenomenal achievement for a Christmas album. DENNIS HUNT

Title: HOLLYWOOD: A DECADE DRIVEN BY DOLLARS, NOT DREAMS; MOVIES: IN A DECADE MARKED BY NATIONWIDE ENTREPRENEURIAL FERVOR, MAJOR STUDIOS WERE DETERMINED TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS ON ALL FRONTS.
Author: ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: 1980S (DECADE); MOTION PICTURES; MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY -- LOS ANGELES; TRENDS; MOTION PICTURE STUDIOS; MOTION PICTURE PRODUCERS; MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY -- FINANCES; PROFITS
Text: The 1980s began with the election of a feel-good President who espoused the entrepreneurial ethic. They ended with the conviction of hotel heiress Leona ("Only little people pay taxes") Helmsley -- capitalist zeal carried to the max. It was a decade marked by synergy, deregulation, acquisitions and mergers; one in which yuppies, Donald Trump, Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky competed with politicians for headlines. "Greed is good," said financier Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone's "Wall Street," a dictum that, perhaps more than any other, summarized the thinking of the day. Hollywood wasn't immune. The repository of American dreams, creator of one of our greatest national exports, was also on the auction block. Strip away the glitz, we found out, and show business is a business like any other. Films and TV shows, like cars and TVs, were up for grabs to the highest bidder. And there were many. With a proliferation of media outlets -- pay cable, foreign TV, home video -- the need for "software," or programming, increased. Far better to own the pie than to pay top dollar for a mere slice. In the TV world, such once-sacred bastions as NBC, ABC and CBS fell to General Electric, Capital Cities Communications and Laurence Tisch. Britain's Television South bought MTM Enterprises. In film, 20th Century Fox was sold to Rupert Murdoch for $575 million in 1985, Columbia Pictures to Sony for $3.4 billion this September. Those unwilling -- or unable -- to buy a whole studio were not turned away. Individual assets were parceled off and sold piecemeal -- like MGM's film library and landmark studio complex, for instance. Just as studios have come to be regarded as a collection of "assets," movies are referred to as "product" -- analyzed in terms of demographics and market-tested (for casting and story line) to ensure customer satisfaction. Despite protests from actress Glenn Close, a crowd-pleasing psychotic ending was tagged on to "Fatal Attraction." MCA/Universal president Sidney Sheinberg got locked in a nasty public squabble with film director Terry Gilliam over the ending of Gilliam's dark 1985 satire, "Brazil." Sheinberg wanted the film re-edited to include a happy ending and Gilliam refused to cooperate. Eventually, the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn., whose members saw "Brazil" at clandestine screenings, voted "Brazil" the best movie of 1985, and Sheinberg reluctantly released the director's cut. It was a rare victory of art over commerce. To studio chiefs, job security has become an alien notion. From Day 1, there's pressure to show earnings to support the price of the stock -- a goal that discourages risk-taking. "The industry is a hit-driven one," says David Geffen, chairman of the independent Geffen Films. "Everyone is trying to hit a bull's-eye every time. Each year, box office goes up and quality goes down. It used to be that movies were high-quality and TV was low-quality. Now they've met at somewhere less than the middle." Mere hits aren't enough. Ever since "Jaws" and "Star Wars" ushered in the Age of the Blockbuster, the tendency has been to swing for the fences. Trying to beat the odds, studios are on the lookout for "franchises," follow-ups to films like " 'Crocodile' Dundee" and "Lethal Weapon" -- seeming sure-shots around which the rest of the release schedule can be built. Sequels have surfaced ad nauseam ("Police Academy 6," "Friday the 13th VIII") in an effort to clone what has worked before. To be fair, things have improved since the mid-'80s, when teen-age sex comedies tended to dominate the screens. Studios woke up to the fact that, while 44% of the movie tickets are sold to people younger than 25, there's a large untapped audience of Baby Boomers eager for intelligent adult fare. In theory, home video and cable should be encouraging more adventurous film making because they can zero in on segmented audiences. In practice, though, the money to be made from exploiting a blockbuster across all the media outlets is so great that few entrepreneurs are willing to settle for the modest returns from more specialized pictures. Theater owners are a case in point. The number of screens proliferated in the last 12 years, up 50% to roughly 24,000 nationwide. But the increase hasn't made for a wider choice of films. Many of them were "multiplexes" -- built in malls -- and shoppers, the reasoning went, were more likely to head for "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" than "River's Edge." Rather than chancing an "art" film in one of their 200-seat theaters, exhibitors would show a more popular film such as "Three Men and a Baby" on several screens at once. The movie glut of a few years back didn't help. If a picture didn't perform -- and perform fast -- it was quickly replaced by another. No time for a small film lacking a big ad campaign or a superstar to find an audience. Garth Drabinsky, the flamboyant chief of the Cineplex Odeon chain, changed the face -- if not the heart -- of the exhibition arena. Calling his company "the Rolls-Royce of theater operators," he upgraded sound systems and improved creature comforts, waking up what had been a Rip-Van-Winkle business. For $2.75 (on top of the newly inflated $7 admission price), one could purchase a country-fresh apple torte in the lobby cafe of the Century Plaza theater -- or drink one of 14 different kinds of tea in Rosenthal china at one of his Toronto operations. Gobbling up screens right and left, dabbling in production as well as exhibition, Drabinsky was even rumored to be the heir apparent at MCA/Universal. Earlier this month, however, he become the latest victim of the movie boom -- stepping down as CEO of Cineplex Odeon, which is now $580 million in debt. Though Universal has managed to squeeze a "Do the Right Thing" and a "Last Temptation of Christ" among its "Twins" and "K-9s," the majors generally regard a "small" film as "prestige product" -- luxuries they can ill afford. Take it from Paul Mazursky, whose "Enemies, a Love Story" (based on an Isaac Bashevis Singer novel) was shot down by every major before being picked up by little Morgan Creek. "The old moguls were emotional," says Mazursky, who just walked off with the New York Film Critics best-director award for "Enemies," which is now flourishing in limited release. "They were immigrants and aspired to class. The only thing these guys get emotional about is a low budget. I pray the independents stick around. Without them, it would be Pap City." Given the current economic climate, Pap City might be the next stop. Though a number of quality independent films have surfaced in 1989 ("sex, lies, and videotape," "My Left Foot"), many of the key players of yesteryear have fallen on hard times. Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti is now the majority shareholder in the Cannon Group. The De Laurentiis Entertainment Group is in Chapter 11. Weintraub Entertainment Group, after a series of box-office disappointments, has placed production on hold. What went wrong? In an increasingly competitive market, they found it hard to compete for high-priced talent, for the good theaters, for advertising space. Some of the independents, heady with their small-scale successes, took on pricier projects with "A-list" stars and directors in the hopes of maximizing profits and gaining legitimacy. Rising costs (currently $18 million to turn out a film, almost half as much to open it) makes each roll of the dice that much riskier. Deep pockets (never the strong suit of the independents) have become a prerequisite of staying power. Those independents that distributed their own films instead of going through majors found themselves in a hole: amassing massive overhead and forced to churn out a product to feed the monster they created. Pre-sales to networks and home video leveled off as each became more selective. Using pre-sales to cover costs also wiped out some potential revenue from the few hits that emerged. Of the 30 U.S.-made pictures released by the independents in September, 1987, not one went on to score at the box office. That's a killer, any way you slice it -- a fact Wall Street learned the hard way. Burned by the assurance of the independents that pre-sales to ancillary markets provided ironclad insurance against losing your shirt, investors found themselves out hundreds of millions of dollars. The stock market crash of '87 proved to be the final nail in the coffin. By 1988, the indie boom had gone bust. "Independents were the victim of two diseases which often plague this business," says entertainment lawyer Peter Dekom. "Ego disease and the failure-to-learn-from-the-mistakes-of-yourself-and-others disease. Between them, they've killed more people in Hollywood than drugs, alcohol and traffic accidents." Studios, faced with rising costs, also drew on outside capital. Limited partnerships (which proliferated in the early to mid-'80s after tax reforms of the late '70s essentially wiped out tax shelters) were one way the majors could raise money cheaply and cover their down side. Speculators would invest a minimum of $5,000 interest-free in a portfolio of films in return for a piece of the net. Not surprisingly, in a business in which only three out of 10 films makes money, no one got rich. Disney's Silver Screen Partners, bolstered by an incredible string of hits, was one of the few delivering a decent return. Even so, participants would have done far better investing in Disney stock. And, instead of selling off some of its considerable upside, cash-rich Disney would have been better off going into the marketplace, borrowing money at current interest rates. Theater ownership was another attempt on the part of the majors to tighten their grip on the industry. A re-interpretation of the anti-trust doctrine over the last decade helped them along. When Columbia Pictures, in a benchmark case, was allowed to purchase part of the Walter Reade theater chain in 1981, other studios jumped in. Warner and Paramount went on to become partners in the Mann and Festival chains (which have since merged to become Cinamerica) and Tri-Star bought the Loews chain. Money from abroad has increased the number of credible players (the Japanese, for instance, have recently provided backing for producer Lawrence Gordon, ex-Columbia chief David Puttnam and independent Morgan Creek), but it's still a giant's game. The majors took in more than 90 cents of every dollar earned from the distribution of movies last year and are expected to be even more dominant in the years ahead. For Hollywood has seen the future, and it's called globalization and consolidation. Short-term, that makes for business as usual. Despite a growing xenophobia in Hollywood, most analysts say foreign money need not spell disaster. In a business that trades on relationships, buyers have wisely opted to keep industry insiders in charge. Sony lined up producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters; Murdoch brought in Paramount's Barry Diller. Says Jeffrey Logsdon, of Crowell, Weedon & Co.: "Murdoch's fingerprints are all over Fox, but he's less conspicuous than in most of his other efforts. Parretti is like a sewing machine, making lots of noise but not getting anywhere. There's a very low probability that the creative community will ever be controlled by one segment of the international marketplace." Down the road, there will be changes, however, and not necessarily for the better. Expect the industry to be more cutthroat than ever before. Media pundits forecast that, when the dust settles, five to seven major media/entertainment companies (Bertelsmann, Murdoch's News Corp., Time-Warner among them) will remain. "There's new pressure to bulk up, to diversify, to compete on all fronts," says Sharon Armbrust of Paul Kagan Associates. "Size has great appeal. You want someone to have to cross your path in order to do business." Battle lines will also be drawn between studios (intent on sidestepping the costly "packages" put together by talent agencies) and heavy-hitters such as Creative Artists Agency, ICM and William Morris who -- with their lock on top-of-the-line directors and stars -- are a path that must also be crossed. The independents also have a toehold -- if they play their cards right. For in the land of the titans, there is room for the little guy, for what producer Gordon calls "the boutique that does great." Doing great, of course, requires injecting a note of moderation into corporate aspirations: keeping a lid on overhead; balancing the risk-reward ratio; relying more on films in the $2-million to $6-million range so mass-audience acceptance is not essential; in short, finding a niche and staying in it. The majors could use some reality checks as well. For spiraling costs took a large chunk out of profits in what should have been a banner decade. And overexpansion makes an industry traditionally unaffected by recession debt-ridden and more vulnerable. If superstars continue to command salaries in the double-digit millions, if studio chiefs negotiate ever more lucrative deals in the wake of the $750-million Guber-Peters package, if box-office and blockbuster dreams continue to hover over each and every creative decision, then the '90s, no doubt, will be a rerun of the '80s: Gordon Gekko revisited.

Title: ARTS PHILANTHROPIST WILLIAM ALEXANDER RECEIVES BY GIVING
Author: BETH KLEID
Abstract: ALEXANDER, WILLIAM; ARTS -- LOS ANGELES; CONTRIBUTIONS; PHILANTHROPY
Text: William Alexander may be a millionaire, but he lives in a small house in the Hollywood Hills, drives an old Toyota station wagon and wears simple clothes. "I don't care for gilded luxuries," said the sprightly 81-year-old. "They don't do anything for me." His life is filled with other riches, for he is Los Angeles' patron-of-the-arts extraordinaire -- a man who for 20 years has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars as well as countless hours to arts groups. This year alone he has provided more than $250,000 to the arts. Name an arts organization in this city and Alexander is involved in it. From the Friends of USC School of Music to the American Youth Symphony to the Los Angeles Mozart Orchestra to the Craft and Folk Art Museum and the Thai Arts Council, the list goes on. He doesn't like the word giving to describe what he does; it sounds too one-sided. "I'd rather call it personalized sharing," he said. "All the leftovers keep me rich -- the vibrations I get from the people and the music and art they create." Usually he is an unsung hero, and he likes it that way. In part, because the retired architect made his fortune on the advice of his lawyer, friend and arts patron, the late Sheldon Andelson, who advised him to riches in real estate. "I never worked for the money, you see," Alexander said, so he doesn't like to be recognized for it. But this month, Alexander was honored at a fund-raiser for the America Israel Cultural Foundation, a group devoted to supporting the arts in Israel, at the UCLA Faculty Center. Alexander is an active member of the foundation, and through it he has set up an annual $25,000 scholarship for promising Israeli artists. The reception featured a program by Orli Shaham, a 13-year-old pianist from Israel. More than 200 people crowded the room to pay tribute to their friend Alexander. In addition to receiving honors from the cultural group, Alexander was presented with a certificate from Mayor Tom Bradley to commend him for his service and for "enriching of the city of Los Angeles." Alexander, overcome with emotion, could barely speak when he accepted the accolades. Yet, in his typically understated manner, Alexander played down the tribute. "I really don't care about getting compliments; I enjoyed the concert more than the words about me," he said later. Although Alexander is hesitant to sing of his own accomplishments, his friends in the art world, such as Gordon Davidson, Ernest Fleischmann, Bella Lewitzky and Jane Fonda, bubble with praise at the mention of his name. Gordon Davidson, executive director of the Mark Taper Forum, said that the great thing about Alexander is that he doesn't give to see his name on a plaque on the wall. "He doesn't do it for ego, or for self-aggrandizement at all, but because he has a true generosity of spirit. "He's one of these people who, when I look out into an audience at whatever cultural event, he's always there," Davidson added. Alexander's contributions do not end with dollars. He's eager to lend a helping hand wherever it's needed, whether it's letting a struggling artist live in his own home, pouring drinks at a reception or mopping the floor. Alexander sounds too good to be true. The energetic octogenarian, with a halo of red hair and dancing blue eyes, truly is the guardian angel of arts and culture in Los Angeles. "I'm not very good at saying no to an arts group," he said. Indeed, Alexander's help is not unappreciated. Plaques and certificates clutter his study, and there are piles of thank-you notes, to which Alexander doesn't pay much attention. "I don't wait for thanks, I don't care about thanks. I just go on to the next thing." Alexander has been good at making things happen throughout his charmed life. At 26, he designed the noted Hangover House in Laguna Beach for Richard Halliburton, the romantic adventurer and writer of the '30s who was lost at sea. In another chapter of his life, Alexander ran a shop called the Mart on Santa Monica Boulevard. In the early '50s, he opened the mart to sell crafts from local artists and folk art from around the world. A Renaissance man, Alexander knows seven languages and has traveled the world. He admits his experiences in life have given him a unique vision. "I am forward-looking -- I am able to see what works." Because he looks to the future, he concentrates on nurturing youth by giving to programs like UCLA's Design for Sharing, which exposes inner-city youths to the fine arts. But he does not neglect the past; in his work with the Arnold Schoenberg Institute at USC, he is dedicated to preserving the works of the composer, who was also a personal friend. Modern, yes. But Alexander would rather be known as a classic. "A classic," he paused, relishing the word. "That's how I want to be remembered."

Title: HOME TECH: EXPERTS PREDICT HIGHER VIDEO RENTAL COSTS, EARLIER RELEASES
Author: DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: VIDEO INDUSTRY; VIDEO RECORDINGS; SALES; TRENDS; CONSUMER SPENDING; RENTALS
Text: The home-video industry, which began the decade as a fledgling with promise, exploded in the mid-'80s into a dominant force in the entertainment scene. Consumers spent more than $11 billion this year, up from $10 billion in 1988, on the sale and rental of videocassettes. Where is the industry headed in the '90s? Industry analyst Dick Kelly of Cambridge Associates in Stamford, Conn., predicts that VCR penetration (the percentage of TV households with VCRs) could reach 80% sometime in the '90s, possibly as early as 1994. Right now, the figure is 66%, which translates into 59.7 million households with one or more VCRs. "With all those VCRs out there, there will be an even greater demand for prerecorded tapes," Kelly said. "The companies that supply the product should do very well in the '90s." Consumers may expect rental prices -- particularly in small stores not affiliated with chains -- to increase. Paramount and MCA have increased their wholesale prices on rental cassettes (the price video companies charge video stores) and, predicted Paul Culberg, executive vice president and CEO of RCA/Columbia, other companies may follow suit. "A $2 increase in the wholesale price this year is very possible," he said. "Part of that increase may be passed on to the consumers in certain situations." Inspired by the home-video debut of "Batman" at $24.98 about five months after its theatrical release, studios are looking to bring out cassettes of many major hit movies -- those grossing $100 million or more -- much sooner than the year or more time delay that characterized the industry in the mid-'80s. "Now you may see more blockbuster movies at a lower price six to eight months after they're released (in theaters)," Culberg said. Culberg cautioned, however, that the early rollout plans might change if consumers don't gobble up the low-priced blockbusters coming out this winter -- "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" and "Lethal Weapon 2." Look for the home video time lag for other films to shrink too. "Movies that come out and vanish after a few weeks may be in video stores as soon as four months after they're released," he said. "But for most movies, that six-month window will hold." Sales volume is likely to increase, but rentals will still drive the business. "Sales will get stronger and the sales percentage of the business may go up a little every year, but not to the point that sales will overtake rentals," Culberg said. "Sales will continue to be the backbone of the business." Traditionally, the bulk of the business in the home-video market has been rentals. Of the $11 billion consumers spent in home video, said Kelly of Cambridge Associates, $9.3 billion went for rentals; $2 billion for sales. The emergence of mass merchants -- discount stores like Target and K mart -- as a primary outlet for prerecorded tapes has been a boon to sales. First of all, these stores are geared sales exclusively. More significantly, they sell tapes at a very low price. Consequently, home-video manufacturers, anxious to feed this new pipeline, have drastically reduced prices. These days, with the low prices, the consumer is more inclined to buy certain cassettes.

Title: CD CORNER: LITTLE RICHARD'S 'SESSIONS' OFFER A STIRRING PIECE OF ROCK HISTORY
Author: ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC
Abstract: COMPACT DISCS; LITTLE RICHARD
Text: "Ladies and gentlemen, good evening . . .," the voice says at the start of a new CD box set from Specialty Records. "At this time I'm going to do my recording of 'Baby' . . . and I hope you like it, too." Apparently turning to his band, he adds, "All right boys . . . ." It was Little Richard (Penniman) speaking, and "Baby" was one of two songs that the future Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member taped at a Macon, Ga., radio station in February, 1955. The goal: landing a recording deal with Specialty Records, a Los Angeles-based R&B and gospel label. Both "Baby" and the second song, "All Night Long," were done in a slow bluesy style and Specialty almost rejected the tape, according to the liner notes accompanying "Little Richard: The Specialty Sessions." In the liner notes, Art Rupe, founder of Specialty, says he listened to the tape with producer Bumps Blackwell and decided Little Richard sang with enough of B. B. King's "feeling" to have commercial potential, especially if some energy were added to the arrangements. So Rupe sent Blackwell to New Orleans that September to record some songs with Little Richard, and one of them, a faster version of "All Night Long," flashes some of the potential that Rupe had heard in the tape. But it was "Tutti Frutti," a high-energy novelty, that would help make this young singer one of the half-dozen most influential stars of early rock. The magnificent new three-disc Specialty set, which sells for about $50, covers the highlights of Little Richard's brief tenure at Specialty, a period when the raw abandon of his vocals was also heard on such hits as "Long Tall Sally," "The Girl Can't Help It," "Jenny Jenny," "Good Golly, Miss Molly" and "Ooh! My Soul." Richard, who left rock at the height of his mid-'50s fame to attend Bible college, would later re-record many of these hits for other labels and cut new songs, but nothing equaled the dramatic power of the Speciality sessions. Besides the hits, the new box includes the original demo tapes, alternate versions, various false starts, studio dialogue and a radio commercial that Little Richard did for a hair product. As such it is an essential piece of rock history -- a marvelously revealing portrait that not only showcases Richard's talent, but documents the contributions the session musicians and producers made to shaping his records. If the nearly three-hour set isn't enough, Ace Records in Britain, with Specialty's cooperation, has put together a six-disc retrospective that includes additional material, mostly alternate versions of the hits. Rupe's daughter, Beverly, who is now president of Specialty Records, said the two projects were assembled in association with singer and historian Billy Vera. The biggest question was how much material to include. They received so many suggestions from Little Richard fans about how to package the historic material that Beverly Rupe includes a note in the box set that explains the company's game plan. "At one extreme was the approach pioneered many years ago by Savoy Records when they issued on LP every note, down to song fragments, played by Charlie Parker," the note explains. "We felt that this presentation works best in the jazz idiom . . . . "The opposite approach would have been to make it a pure entertainment, 'Greatest Hits,' package. But that ground has already been amply covered by more compact Little Richard sets . . . suited to the nostalgia-for-your-car crowd. "Our aim here was to find a middle ground which would enable us to take a respectful, dignified, historical, even scholarly look at Richard's years at Specialty Records, and still put out a record that was fun and would be listened to over and over." BUDGET BIN: New budget or midline CD titles include Joe Jackson's "Night and Day," the Chambers Brothers' "Time Has Come," Johnny Mathis' "More Greatest Hits," Muddy Waters' "I'm Ready," Marvin Gaye's "Romantically Yours," Barbra Streisand's "Streisand & Other Instruments," the Isley Brothers' "Shout!/The Complete Victor Sessions" and Yes' "Drama."

Title: ANN CONWAY: THE 1980S: A LITERAL GLITZ BLITZ
Author: ANN CONWAY
Abstract: null
Text: Orange County society won't be crying in their Dom Perignon when they say "see ya" to the '80s. It's been a vintage decade for the glitz-set. For starters, the Orange County Performing Arts Center opened in 1986, giving the glitterati a stylish new way to spend an evening: First, they dress to kill. Then, they dine at an A-list bistro near the Center (usually Antonello), watch a performance at Segerstrom Hall and then party till the wee hours at a nearby hot spot (usually the posh and private Center Club.). We're still shaking our heads in disbelief. Clothing vendor Amen Wardy installed a ballroom, complete with crystal chandeliers, in his maze-like boutique in Newport Center Fashion Island. Its opening-night bash in 1984 saw sexy Joan Collins, dripping in spangles, and then-husband Peter Holm ogling designer wear while party guests ogled them. In recent years, Wardy's showplace has been the site of Orange County's most-talked-about luncheon-fashion show, the one annually sponsored by Angelitos de Oro, a support group of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Orange County. Regularly on the guest list: members of the international society set such as fashion superstars Oscar de la Renta and Bob Mackie. Something we loved to see disappear in the '80s: the canopy of blue smoke that used to hang like a rain cloud over a ballroom while a party was in progress. Now, smoking cigarettes during a bash precipitates "who let you in?" stares. Polite guests puff outdoors. Ashtrays are rarely found on party tables. Something we hated to see appear in the '80s: "The valet stomp," the itchy-twitchy dance step party-goers execute post-party time, while they wait for their Jags, Rollses, Ferraris and Mercedeses. Some hotels have valet parking only (tsk tsk). And some hotels need to hire more valets. Now that you're primed for looking back, grab that Mont Blanc pen. It's time to take the 1989 Society Trivia Quiz, the end-of-the-season game that tests your social IQ. Now don't go kicking your secretary in the shins if you miss a few. You were probably so busy kicking up your heels, you didn't have time to read this column. But if you get them all right, something is dreadfully wrong. You've got to get out more, stop being the voyeur. (Answers below.) 1.

Title: THE CHINESE OF ORANGE COUNTY; PARENTS WANT TO PRESERVE HERITA, THEIR CHILDREN WANT FAST TRACK TO ASSIMILATION
Author: HERMAN WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: CHINESE LANGUAGE; ORANGE COUNTY -- SCHOOLS; ETHNIC GROUPS; ORANGE COUNTY -- CULTURE; MINORITIES -- ORANGE COUNTY; CHINESE AMERICANS -- ORANGE COUNTY; IRVINE CHINESE SCHOOL; IMMIGRANTS; CHINESE AMERICANS -- CULTURE; ASSIMILATION
Text: At the stroke of 9 on a Sunday morning, students by the hundreds are arriving at the deserted University High School campus in Irvine. Lines of Mercedes-Benzes, BMWs and Toyotas drop them off from stylish homes in Newport Beach, Anaheim Hills and Tustin. Dressed in trendy sweats and high-top tennies, they jostle, gossip and kid among themselves as they make their way to class. These are Chinese-Americans gathering for their weekly three-hour classes at the Irvine Chinese School that operates out of rented buildings on the University campus. The rest of the week they lead quiet lives in some of the county's best neighborhoods, but they are prodded relentlessly by their parents to be examples of the "model minority" while they pursue the fastest track possible in American assimilation. Yet each Sunday they enter another world in which they speak only Mandarin, recite Confucian fables and attend lectures on Chinese history and the sciences. The sight of 700 Chinese-Americans ages 5 to 18 crowded into this quintessentially American campus in a quintessentially American suburban town is stunning. Make no mistake: This school is nothing less than a Sunday congregation of the cultural faithful. A rousing affirmation of ethnic roots. An extended Chinese family of 700. Despite the fact that it is now 13 years old and the second largest of 80 such Chinese cultural schools in Southern California, the Irvine Chinese School is still virtually unknown outside Asian communities. Yet it and the 15 others like it in the county tell much about an undeniable fact of demographics here: namely, the Asianization of Orange County. True, nearly all attention has been on the influx of two other Asian peoples here, the the Vietnamese, who now number about 100,000, and the Koreans, who now number about 70,000. But those groups have high visibility. The Little Saigon and Koreatown strips in central Orange County are two of the biggest commercial enclaves of their kind in the United States, and they have stirred resentment among some Caucasian residents who fear that the groups are trying to undermine the primacy of English and to erect compounds of their own on American soil. The Chinese population here has a much lower profile, although it wasn't always so. Anti-Asian feeling had been building since the 1870s because of the competition for laborers' jobs. In May of 1906, when anti-Asian sentiment was at its height throughout California, Santa Ana's tiny Chinatown was burned down by city fathers who considered it a blight and feared it would produce an outbreak of leprosy. There were only a few hundred Chinese living here at the time. It would be decades before they would settle here in any great numbers. In 1960, the Chinese population in the county was just 444; in 1970, it was 2,832, but by 1980 their number had increased to 14,213, and for 1990, it is projected to be at least 20,000. Researchers say most of the increase since the 1970s represent people who have emigrated -- some from Hong Kong, but most from Taiwan -- and that these people are generally more affluent, more educated and more sophisticated in their adoption of American ways than their predecessors. In a study of Asian immigration, UC Irvine assistant professor John Liu, a member of the university's Comparative Culture Program, found that newcomers from Taiwan accounted for 72% of the 3,996 Chinese who settled in Orange County between 1983 and 1986, far outnumbering those from Hong Kong and China. It appears that these newcomers deliberately bypassed the traditional Chinese enclaves in Los Angeles County, including Monterey Park, for the anonymity of Orange County suburbia. "These are immigrants who seek what everyone else seeks -- Caucasian Americans included -- from this society," Liu said. "They want the kind of job mobility, schools and leisure that go with the American Dream life style of an Orange County." In fact, Orange County, which has never had a big Chinatown in the usual sense, is fast becoming one of the most sought-after suburban destinations in the United States for this newer wave of high-status Chinese newcomers, Liu and other Chinese-American researchers said. The Chinese immigrants who live in Monterey Park and in the other enclaves of the San Gabriel Valley "don't have to -- or want to -- venture outside the Chinatowns," said Celia Young, a Laguna Niguel-based consultant in Asian-American relations. "They have reconstructed a Chinese society right there. But this group clearly doesn't want to live like that," she said of those who have chosen Orange County. Instead, she said, "they are willing to become immersed in the Caucasian society, but hoping to do so without losing their (Chinese) identity." A comment by Shih-how Chang, principal of the Irvine Chinese School, typifies the attitude of this group: "We seek the best for our families, for our children," said Chang, who is an American-educated engineer. "We do this," that is, live in Orange County, "because here we can give our children the best from two cultures." No group personifies this phenomenon better than the 450 families who underwrite and operate the Irvine Chinese School. They have high-status jobs. Most of the men are engineers -- the professional job most traditionally most frequently chosen by Chinese immigrants and American-born Chinese, according to studies -- but the roster also includes computer scientists, physicians, professors and manufacturing-firm owners. The roster also includes at least one link to a monumental event in China's past: Kia-lin Sun is a great-granddaughter of Sun Yat-sen, the most revered leader in the uprising against the Qing Dynasty that led to its overthrow in 1911 and '12. Most of the school's parents were born on the China mainland in the 1930s and 1940s. Some lived in Japanese-occupied sectors such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Shenyang. Others lived in areas still held by Chinese forces, including Chongqing, the wartime capital that was heavily bombed through the war. When the Communist armies swept into full control of the mainland in the late '40s, the families fled to Taiwan, the last stronghold for Chinese Nationalists. Taiwan became a model of economic prosperity, although not of political democracy. Hundreds of Taiwan's best students became part of another flight in the 1960s and 1970s -- this time to the United States to pursue graduate degrees. Their exodus was encouraged with the repealing of anti-Asian immigration laws and the increasing willingness of American firms to hire Chinese professionals. Many of these expatriates found work in high-tech industries and chose to stay permanently in America, becoming American citizens and starting families. For most, it apparently was not political objections that brought them here. "They didn't leave Taiwan because of the limited political freedoms there," said Young, who is also a member of the Irvine Chinese School board. "If anything, politics have always played a small role in these people's lives." What attracted them most was the belief in America as the promised land, the fabled vision of the Gold Mountain of the original Chinese immigrants in the 19th Century. The farmers and laborers of Guangdong Province had emigrated expecting to reap great wealth, then return home. Families in the later waves of immigration threw themselves into the process of becoming acculturated in their new society, but they always stopped far short of full assimilation for themselves and for their children. Their situation is the classic one for any immigrant group. "They feel they are an endangered species in this country, maybe the last of their line to truly practice and honor the traditional Chinese ways," said Albert Chu, whose son attended the school. Chu is president of the Asian American Planning Council in Orange County, an umbrella organization for Asian-American community groups. Another parent, engineer Tsun-sen Fu, whose wife, Mitzi, was principal of the Irvine Chinese School when it opened with 30 students in 1975, put it this way: "We are worried, yes, that our children will forget where their families came from, what we lived through, what we believe in. Yes, we are very concerned about our children's Chinese identity, about their roots." The weekly Chinese culture and language classes are one answer. The schools, launched by the parents themselves and supported by tuition fees, have multiplied over the past several years. There are now 16 in Orange County with a total enrollment of 3,000. The Irvine program is the largest, but other major schools include those in Huntington Beach, Anaheim Hills, Fullerton and Fountain Valley. The parents do not rely on the formal instruction on Sunday mornings alone, however. They reinforce the Chinese traditions at home. The parents are role models. They pride themselves on their smooth entry into American society -- mingling easily with Caucasians at work and at American school functions, cultivating the image of being low-profile, hard-working, well-behaved achievers -- part of the model minority. Yet their social lives still revolve around other Chinese, the preferred language is still Mandarin or another Chinese dialect, and their reverence for Chinese traditions is powerfully maintained. They insist that their children adhere to the Chinese traditions of familial obedience, respect for elders, observing ancient holidays and seeking perfection through diligent attention to education. Specialists in intercultural relations, however, point out that some of these parents, like many in other Asian immigrant groups -- underestimate the stresses their children confront in trying to satisfy the demands of two cultures. Speaking of the experience of Asian immigrants in general, Gene Awakuna, a psychologist and director of UC Irvine's student counseling services, put it this way: "The parents believe they are doing the right thing, but because the parents are themselves so secure in their own (Asian) identity, they don't know what it means to suffer from these kinds of bicultural shocks." Awakuna teaches acculturation classes at UC Irvine, whose enrollment is now more than 35% Asian. Many such children are torn as they try to achieve a balance between independence and traditional devotion to duty. Another pressure point is socializing with people outside the ethnic group. For example, many Chinese parents tolerate interracial dating, seeing it as a reality of American society, but most are still appalled by the prospect of interracial marriage. Chu of the Asian American Planning Council says that the Chinese schools are not there just to pass the torch of heritage. They also provide a Chinese socialization "that is the schools' hidden agenda -- to encourage students to think about marrying, but only to another Chinese," he said. Most family tensions, though, seem to revolve around the traditional study-and-work ethics. Chinese parents, for instance, never cease citing the higher-than-average numbers of Chinese students on high school honors lists or in the student bodies of schools such as Harvard and Stanford universities and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "That's the complaint you hear most often" from Asian students -- "that their parents are always pushing them to do even more homework, to get those high grades, to not shame the family," said consultant Young, who conducts workshops for Asian students. All this raises an exceptionally sensitive issue -- the matter of mental health. According to Chu, who is a county social worker, cases of extreme mental stress -- including incidents of parental abuse and children running away -- have been reported among Asian immigrants. And, he added, as with "any other racial group, these cases cut across all economic and occupational lines." Still, the number of mental health problems reported for Asians is very low. But Chu said that the low rates are a reflection of the scarcity of counselors who speak Asian languages and Asians' well-known aversion to "airing their problems to outsiders." Yet in the view of Chu and others, Asian families such as those associated with the Irvine Chinese School are probably coping better than most and are less likely to exhibit "extreme behaviors." The field is still lacking in authoritative studies on bicultural stress among such families, but Chu offered this view: "They don't live in isolation. They have fewer (English) language problems and are better educated. Many have resided here since they were graduate students. "We have to assume that their adjustments -- as difficult as they may be -- are comparatively less stressful." But even a smoothly acculturating Asian group, specialists said, is not spared the shocks of American racism. One Irvine Chinese School parent who asked not to be named discussed the issue of racism this way: "When Caucasians get to know us, understand that we are good citizens and take care of ourselves, then there can be no problems. It is like football. If you do a good job, it is the score that counts -- not your culture or color." He and other Chinese parents interviewed acknowledged the existence of the noisier evidence of new anti-Asian rancor such as the recent attacks on the use of Asian languages in the Monterey Park and central Orange County enclaves. One Chinese school student who made a more candid appraisal added: "Oh yeah, it is still there -- the taunts, the crude jokes -- but you get used to it. "These things come in cycles. People now resent us because we're not acting quiet and docile. It seems all they ever read is about (Asians) coming here with bags of cash, buying up everything." But, specialists argue, this is a reflection of Asians' higher racial visibility and the higher levels of fear and rancor that come with that visibility. Liu, the UC Irvine social scientist, described the situation this way: "Do these people think (Asians) are better, brighter? I think not. They look upon us in much the same way they did back in the last century: We're seen as devious and sneaky, and that's why we get ahead!" Despite these attitudes -- or because of them -- activists have long been urging younger Chinese-Americans to take matters into their own hands and make a peace with their dual identities. To consultant Young, herself a China-born American immigrant, this idea is especially valid for American-born students such as those in the Irvine Chinese School classes. Students like these, Young said, "have to find their own middle space. They have to accept the fact they are bicultural and different -- and that this is perfectly normal." And, Young added, "they have to tell themselves that it's OK to take pride in their Chinese-ness, to let it come out in the open." Even if that means being Chinese only part time. Once a week. Every Sunday. For three hours. It's another Sunday at the Irvine Chinese School. The 700 students were dutifully in their classes, reciting Confucian tales, brush-drawing ancient Chinese characters, taking spot quizzes on new words. The youngest, barely 5 years old, were sitting wide-eyed in a room repeating the latest parable line by line and sound by sound. On the plaza, boys in cross-buttoned uniforms were kicking up a storm in the kung fu class. Inside a hall, girls with bamboo sticks danced gently to a traditional song. And there were scores of parents -- some going through tai chi paces, some in choral practice -- others holding their little weekly reunions, chatting and laughing, their Mandarin sounding so natural, so properly in place despite the surroundings. There were gaps in this mini reconstruction of a Chinese society. During class breaks, students lapsed into English, as if coming up for air before the next immersion into Mandarin. And there was this role-reversal oddity: Three adult Caucasian students were huddled over the calligraphy tables doing their best to learn the basic strokes of written Chinese. But overall, the mood was one denoting a gathering of a very specific ethnic clan. "We need to be together, even for a day, because out there it is not the same. I need it for myself, for my children," said a 43-year-old Hong Kong-reared businessman. "Oh, my kids don't like it one bit. I have to drag them here. Maybe some day -- maybe they will understand." Maybe. "I used to feel that way," said Michelle Ko, 17, president of the school's student activities council. "But you grow up. You begin to see what parents are getting at. I know kids now in universities or overseas, and they're taking Chinese again!" Said another 17-year-old, Steven Huang: "You get to feel the linkage between generations. I like that. I used to feel not quite American, not quite Chinese. Now, maybe, it's not as confusing. America is a multicultural society, right?" Billy Chen, also 17, tried to sum it all up. "OK, it's not really that bad," he said of the school. "You know, I kind of look forward to it. It's like seeing your kinfolk. Hey, it's like one big family!" At the stroke of noon, the classes stopped, the spell was broken, the students were taken away, back to their places in the American society. For another week.

Title: PARENTS TOLERATE AMERICANIZATION; CHILDREN GAIN RESPECT FOR HERITAGE
Author: HERMAN WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: CHINESE LANGUAGE; FAMILIES; ETHNIC GROUPS; ORANGE COUNTY -- CULTURE; MINORITIES -- ORANGE COUNTY; CHINESE AMERICANS -- ORANGE COUNTY; IRVINE CHINESE SCHOOL; CHINESE AMERICANS -- CULTURE; ASSIMILATION; IMMIGRANTS
Text: After 21 years of living in America, Shih-how and Jane Chang have witnessed the slow but unmistakable Americanization of their three daughters. No matter how often they speak Chinese to them, no matter how many stories of their families and the "old country" they pass on, no matter how many Chinese classes are given, the parents see in their own daughters the gradual loss of a great heritage. It isn't that the Changs didn't expect this to happen. It is the rapidity and thoroughness of their daughters' Americanization that amazes them. And recently, as if to underscore the reach of assimilation in their family, their eldest daughter married a Caucasian. But the parents, immigrants from Taiwan who became U.S. citizens more than a decade ago, had long ago made their choice. "America is our home. If you do your best here, you have more opportunities. Our children will have them too. But we know there will be cultural adjustments too," said Shih-how, 54, an American-educated engineer and the current principal of the parent-run Irvine Chinese School. As he spoke, his serious, bespectacled demeanor and carefully worded English seemed to fit the stereotype of Chinese in America. Yet both parents' naturally vibrant personalities can surface quickly, even among strangers, especially when the Changs slip back into speaking Mandarin. But the subject this evening at their Irvine home was a particularly crucial one, and Jane Chang, 53, also confronted this matter of assimilation solemnly. "Yes, I worry a lot about it," she said in still halting English. "Yes, it makes me sad when the culture goes, the language goes. When young people look like a Chinese, but don't speak or think Chinese, it is very sad." It may be that assimilation, at least in the case of the Chang daughters, hasn't been that thorough. Consider this from 25-year-old Sherry Jystad, whose vivacity and restless curiosity -- like her sisters Julie, 20, and Karen, 16 -- is as much Chinese as it is American. "Now we realize that we're a lot more Chinese than we thought," said Sherry, a UC Irvine-educated computer programmer. "This surprises us because -- living here in Orange County -- most of our friends and the things we do are non-Chinese." Maybe, she suggested, something of what they were taught by their parents and at the Irvine Chinese School has rubbed off. (The girls first attended in 1980 when they moved to Irvine after living in San Diego, New Orleans and Wichita, Kan.) Maybe it's because of the trendiness of books, films and plays by Asian-Americans -- whose works provide a cathartic experience for children of Chinese immigrants, especially the widely noted stories of Maxine Hong Kingston and Amy Tan. And maybe it's the overall experience of simply growing up, and, added Julie, an engineering major at UC Irvine, "seeing some things a lot clearer and gaining more understanding of your parents." Yet, said Julie, who studied Chinese culture in Taiwan last year in a summer institute for American-born Chinese, "We really don't have to define just how we discovered it (Chinese identity). As long as we know it's a part of us that we now recognize and treasure." This was not always so apparent. Like most children at the Irvine Chinese School, the Chang girls had intensely disliked the whole idea of ethnic schools, and not just because it meant extra school and extra homework. "We kept thinking: Why are we going to these classes? The reasons seemed so obscure to us," said Julie, who first attended the cultural and Mandarin language classes at age 11. "To us it was just to please our parents, because they told us to do it." Indeed, the classes seemed one more traditional duty to fulfill for the parents -- most of whom, like Shih-how and Jane Chang, were born on the Chinese mainland -- and who demanded obedience, familial responsibilities and school achievement in the strictest sense. But the classes also made many children feel even more racially apart. They felt embarrassed whenever speaking Chinese outside the home or whenever their parents behaved in a stereotypical "Chinese" manner. They felt profoundly lacking in the kinds of independence and spontaneity that their Caucasian friends took for granted. And, in the classic conflicts so detailed in contemporary Asian-American literature, the children felt lost in a bicultural chasm. "You felt like in a void. Our parents were expecting us to be good Chinese," Sherry said. "The (American) schools were teaching us to be good Americans." Yet, their Chinese-ness has slowly begun to surface. "For me, it was the literature. Reading works like (Amy Tan's) 'The Joy Luck Club,' " Sherry explained. "I saw our families, particularly our mothers, come to life in those stories (about immigrant mothers and American-raised daughters). I laughed -- and cried -- throughout that book." For Julie, who was also moved by the Tan stories, her sense of ethnic liberation came in that trip last year to Taiwan (which she took only at her parents' insistence). "I met hundreds of (American-born Chinese) students like myself -- confused, a little like lost souls," Julie recalled. "It was a revelation. We all had the same kind of families. We felt a special closeness, like finding what our parents had been saying all along." If the daughters have changed -- so, too, apparently, have the Chang parents. "They have adapted terrifically well, we think," said the youngest, Karen. "Oh sure, they're still very traditional. But they have accepted change, like giving us more say-so, more independence." And they have even tolerated marriage to a non-Chinese. Although Shih-how and Jane Chang, like most Chinese immigrant parents, still strongly prefer that their children marry only Chinese, they have shown acceptance of Sherry's marriage to Glenn Jystad. Sherry and Glenn, also 25 and a computer programmer, had met five years earlier at UC Irvine. "My feeling is that if they are happy, if they get along and like each other, it does not matter what the color is," Shih-how said. Jane, who had been the most outspoken about the marriage, described it this way: "I like Glenn. He has a real happy personality and even temperament. He has a good education and job." After the wedding last October, when Glenn asked Jane how she should be addressed -- "Mrs. Chang? Mother Chang? -- his mother-in-law retorted: "Mom, of course!" In other ways, Jane Chang still defies Americanization. She shops only at Chinese markets, such as those in Little Saigon, Santa Ana and Monterey Park. She cooks only Chinese meals: her favorite seafood, pork, vegetable and bean-curd dishes. She brings along precooked Chinese goodies whenever they travel to areas not blessed with Chinese restaurants. She never misses her mah-jongg sessions every month in Orange and Los Angeles counties. She is still a devoted fan of Taiwan-filmed soap operas, renting video versions from nearby Chinese stores. And she has not surrendered her fondest hopes for future generations. She still dreams of Julie and Karen marrying -- of course -- a Chinese. And when Sherry and Glenn's first child is born, when she is called upon for baby-sitting duty, she will -- of course -- lavish the child with love and coos. But grandmother Chang's bedtime tales will be about Old China. And she will read and speak to the child -- but of course -- in Chinese.

Title: OLDER GENERATION FEARS YOUNG WILL LET ROOTS SLIP AWAY
Author: HERMAN WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER
Abstract: CHINESE LANGUAGE; FAMILIES; ETHNIC GROUPS; ORANGE COUNTY -- CULTURE; MINORITIES -- ORANGE COUNTY; CHINESE AMERICANS -- ORANGE COUNTY; IRVINE CHINESE SCHOOL; GRANDPARENTS; IMMIGRANTS; CHINESE AMERICANS -- CULTURE; ASSIMILATON
Text: In the heart of Orange County, in a typically stylish Irvine home, but in a ceremony as old as China itself, Tze-fan Deng will be there to honor her ancestors. This family observance Jan. 26, the eve of Chinese New Year's Day, will be led by the tiny 78-year-old matriarch herself and held in her son Eh Deng's residence. Many of her children and grandchildren will attend. The incense will be burned. The traditional wine, fish and meats will be meticulously arranged. As it should be. As members of this clan have done on each ancestral ceremony wherever they lived. Shanghai. Taipei. Singapore. Montreal. Dallas. Irvine. "We cannot forget the old customs, the old ways of respect," the matriarch said during a recent visit to the home, also in Irvine, of her daughter, Ping, and son-in-law, Hon Yow. Clearly, Tze-fan Deng has not forgotten tradition. She still prefers wearing the traditional Chinese dresses, speaks only in the Mandarin and Shanghai dialects and remains unfailingly polite to outsiders, especially those who speak only English. But the matriarch, born in China's Jiangsu Province, an exile for years in Taiwan and now an American resident, still has a commanding aura, unflinching eyes and fierce ethnic pride. And the mission now is to pass on the Chinese heritage, even here in America, even though she is all-too-mindful of the enormous erosion to her native culture. Asked if she felt the younger Chinese-American generations are becoming too Americanized, too forgetful of their Chinese past, Tze-fan Deng replied -- with politely terse but sweeping understatement: "Yes, I think so. A little." Hon and Ping Yow already fear that their daughters, Loraine, 8, and Rowena, 6 -- both American-born and American-raised -- may be losing too much of their Chinese-ness. So, like all the other parents affiliated with the Irvine Chinese School, the Yows have taken certain precautions. They speak only Chinese to their children. They impress upon them the importance of traditional Chinese obligations at home and exemplary performance in the schools. And each Sunday morning at the Irvine Chinese School, the Yow girls join the other children, practicing spoken and written Chinese, being told about Chinese cultural and scientific achievements. However, the Yows, like the other Chinese school parents, said it is "wrong" and "a misunderstanding" for others to contend -- as some "English only" American advocates do -- that this kind of bilingual, ethnic-pride activism can perpetuate Asian isolation. Besides, this issue, the Yows suggested, is not really so simple. For one thing, no one is questioning the obvious fact that English "is America's language." And Hon said their belief is strong that "America is the best place in the world in so many ways -- the best democracy, the most stable system, the most opportunities for our children." Indeed, Hon added, Chinese immigrant parents "believe we can be proud of being American citizens and still be proud of being Chinese." Most of the parents in the Chinese school, including the Yows, are U.S. citizens. "America is famous as a multicultural society, where other people -- from Europe, from Latin America, from other countries -- also want to preserve the languages and heritage," said Ping, who was principal of the Irvine school in 1988-89. "For us, the old language is the key to preserving the old culture," she said. "For many (immigrants), it is the way we communicate." The Yows' most personal goal -- their "Chinese dream," they said -- is to return sometime in the next few years to Taiwan or Singapore with their daughters. Asked if bringing their children back to live in Asia might be resented by some Americans, Ping, who was born in Shanghai, replied: "It would be the same as American students, those in college, who go abroad to study or work to learn about a second culture," she said. "Only, we want to give our children this same opportunity while they are younger." "It would be for only a few years," she added. "It would not be forever." "Books are fine, and we are grateful for having a Chinese school" in Irvine, said Hon, who was born in Malaysia, his father an immigrant from China's Guangdong Province. But, he added, "this is not quite the same. Our children should have the chance of direct experience, of being there in the old society." The Yows themselves have engaged in this kind of global mobility. Hon, 45, an engineer, was schooled in Singapore and Bangkok and studied at Taiwan National University. Ping, 42, a graduate of the same university, went on to study sociology in Canada in the early 1970s and hold jobs in Houston and Boston. And after they were married in Taipei in 1978, Hon's line of work took them elsewhere on the international circuit -- first to Olympia, Wash., back to Singapore, then finally to Irvine in 1985. Such a plan for their children would greatly please the family matriarch. After all, said Tze-fan Deng's daughter, the issue, as always, comes down to passing the torch. "We know what can happen to the children," Ping said. "They go through a period of doubts. They are not proud of our heritage." Ping, her voice subdued, then added: "We don't want that to happen. We must do our best to avoid it. It would be a very terrible loss." Like the other Irvine Chinese School parents, the Yows feel an immense loss over the martial-law crackdown in China. For decades, a return to the mainland was unthinkable, particularly for such families as Ping's, who fled to Nationalist-governed Taiwan in the late 1940s and have their own stories of Communist persecution to remember. Ping was barely 2 years old when her father -- Jack Deng, a Shanghai textile entrepreneur -- had to bring the family to Taiwan, just as the Communist armies were sweeping closer to the Yangtze River delta. When her father returned alone to Shanghai in early 1949 to find a sister and recover some textile machinery, he was captured by the Communists and imprisoned. Later, the new regime allowed him to run his old factory. But in 1962, he managed to flee to Hong Kong, where he eventually rebuilt his business. In 1977, he died of a lung ailment, the result, his family said, of his Communist imprisonment. By the late 1970s, when the Beijing regime was opening the mainland to more tourists and foreign ventures, Chinese from outside regions began returning to see aging relatives. Hon Yow, then working for a Singapore corporation, in 1986 made a hotel-development business trip to the mainland -- his first visit ever there -- that included a meeting with relatives in Guangzhou. And Ping's 78-year-old mother, Tze-fan Deng, in 1986 traveled to Shanghai for a reunion, the first in 38 years, with her sister and other relatives there. Ping did not go. "Before (last) June 4, I thought I might eventually go. I felt there was some hope there," Ping explained. "But no, not after Tian An Men (the massacre). People are scared to go now." Neither she nor Hon plan to return. "All of a sudden, any hope is crushed. It makes us feel so angry, so sad, so helpless," she said. Then Ping Yow added, softly: "I don't think there is any more hope for democracy there. Not in my lifetime."

Author: Times Wire Services
Abstract: null
Text: The Drug Enforcement Administration rejected a recommendation today that marijuana be reclassified for use as a prescription medicine to treat patients suffering from glaucoma, cancer and other diseases. DEA Administrator John Lawn announced the order, saying the hallucinogenic drug will remain "under the strictest level of federal control." The Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws first petitioned the agency in the 1970s, seeking to make marijuana available for medical use. Administrative Law Judge Francis Young, who presided over hearings in the case, recommended in 1988 that the DEA recognize marijuana as having medicinal applications. Lawn rejected that judge's recommendation, finding "a lack of credible evidence to support a conclusion that safety, efficacy and acceptance had been demonstrated for the medical use of marijuana."

Abstract: null
Text: Accusing the Bush Administration of "thievery" of Social Security Trust Fund money, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said today he plans to introduce a bill repealing a 1990 increase in Social Security taxes. Moynihan said the measure, to be introduced when Congress returns Jan. 23, would save a couple paying at the top rate about $600 in taxes and would result in a $55-billion tax cut for the nation. He said he was making the proposal because it had become clear that the Administration was using trust fund surpluses to finance the federal budget deficit, perverting the original purpose of the fund surplus to provide for retirement payments in the next century. "There is one word for this . . . and it is thievery," Moynihan told a news conference.

Title: CZECHS NAME PLAYWRIGHT AS PRESIDENT; EAST BLOC: VACLAV HAVEL IS UNANIMOUSLY ELECTED BY PARLIAMENT TO BECOME THE NATION'S FIRST NON-COMMUNIST LEADER IN FOUR DECADES.
Author: Associated Press
Abstract: null
Text: Parliament today crowned the nation's peaceful revolution by electing playwright and opposition leader Vaclav Havel as Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist president in 41 years. In an unprecedented public vote that was televised nationwide, the Communist-dominated Parliament, or Federal Assembly, unanimously chose Havel, who was jailed for five years by the previous hard-line Communist leadership for speaking out against totalitarianism. "I will not disappoint you, but will lead this country to free elections," Havel told hundreds of cheering supporters from a balcony of the presidential Hradcany Castle after his election. "This must happen in a decent and peaceful way so that the clean face of our revolution is not sullied," he said. "It is a task for us all." The election of Havel, 53, is the crowning achievement of the popular revolt that began only 41 days ago. It comes amid democratic reforms in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania. Havel and his wife, Olga, later walked across the courtyard from the castle to the St. Vitus Cathedral for a special Mass of thanksgiving given by Czechoslovakia's 90-year-old Roman Catholic prelate, Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek. At the entrance to the Gothic cathedral, several young girls presented Havel with bouquets of white lilies. "We came to St. Vitus . . . to thank God for the great hope that has opened before us in the last days of this year," Tomasek told the crowd. The cathedral was filled with Antonin Dvorak's "Te Deum" played by the Prague Philharmonic and choir after the short service. The lawmakers' meeting was opened by Alexander Dubcek, champion of the "Prague Spring" reforms crushed in 1968. He was returned to power Thursday when Parliament elected him Speaker of the body.

Text: A father hoping to surprise his children with a tape recorder for Christmas got a surprise of his own -- the device contained a tape of conversations involving drug dealing. An Indianapolis man purchased the recorder at a Wal-Mart store on Dec. 23, Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Stephen G. Golden said. The man noticed the tape inside the player, listened to it and turned it over to authorities. The tape was made secretly by parents of a teen-ager who suspected their daughter was dealing drugs, Golden said. The parents used a phone answering tape device. Investigators believe the girl learned of the recording and took the tape to the store to play, leaving it in a display model, Golden said. When the recorder was the only one left, employees boxed it and sold it to the Indianapolis man.

Title: HONG KONG POLICE STORM REFUGEE SITE; BOAT PEOPLE: TENSIONS AMONG 56,000 VIETNAMESE GROW IN THE FACE OF A PROMISED NEW ROUND OF FORCED REPATRIATIONS.
Author: United Press International
Abstract: null
Text: Riot police firing tear gas stormed a refugee camp today, seizing more than 400 weapons and arresting boat people only hours after a group of 111 Vietnamese voluntarily returned to their homeland. It was the second consecutive day of disturbances in Hong Kong's tense detention centers, where more than 56,000 Vietnamese are awaiting resettlement abroad or a one-way ticket back to Hanoi. One Vietnamese was killed in what officials said was a gang fight in a closed detention center Thursday night. The clashes came in the face of a promised new round of forced repatriations to Vietnam by British and Hong Kong authorities, who say the voluntary program is too slow to make a substantial reduction in the population of the colony's crowded camps. At least 21 officers and eight boat people were hurt today in the melee in the Chi Ma Wan detention center, where authorities said Vietnamese threatened security forces and threw stones at them during what was described as a "routine search" for hidden weapons. More than 300 police and detention officers in full riot gear stormed one section of the camp, firing canisters of tear gas into crowds of boat people. Police said they arrested 19 Vietnamese and seized 430 weapons in the operation. Secretary for Security Geoffrey Barnes said authorities negotiated for five hours with the boat people to give up their weapons and allow a search before officers moved in. "However, despite repeated efforts to obtain the cooperation of the boat people and warnings that the search would have to be carried out regardless of their objections, the boat people still refused to give up their weapons," Barnes said. "In the circumstances, (detention officers) and police were forced to conduct the search as planned. "The boat people, in order to make the operation more difficult, pushed their women and children to the front. In the end, it was necessary for (tear gas) to be used to disperse the crowds and to reduce the possibility of serious injuries." The clash came hours after a group of 111 boat people voluntarily left Hong Kong this morning on a chartered airliner for Hanoi rather than face months or years in the crowded camps without hope of resettlement abroad. Those who left today made up the eighth group to return to Hanoi under a U.N.-sponsored voluntary repatriation program, bringing to more than 865 the number of Vietnamese who have willingly gone home. Police said there was no apparent reason for the uprising at Chi Ma Wan.

Abstract: null
Text: The Navy is proposing to put two of its four battleships in mothballs and limit purchases of the $1.2-billion Trident submarine to every other year, a senior Pentagon official said today. But the service, studying proposals for the new fiscal year budget, is fighting to spare at least 14 aircraft carriers from White House pressures to trim the military's most favored weapons programs. President Bush, who is slated to deliver his budget to Congress on Jan. 22, may be called upon to make the final decisions on any suggested cuts, given their controversial nature. "We're robbing Peter to pay Paul," the Pentagon official said of the current budget-juggling exercise. He spoke on condition of anonymity. White House budget planners have told Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that he can spend a little more than $292 billion in the new budget year, which begins Oct. 1. That means Pentagon spending will not keep pace with inflation.

Title: GEORGIA MAY CUT SHRIMP SEASON OVER COLD WEATHER
Author: United Press International
Abstract: null
Text: The Department of Natural Resources is reconsidering its decision to extend the shrimping season through January because of a recent cold snap that decimated the shrimp population in coastal waters, a department official said today. Informal talks with shrimpers this week indicated that the cold spell had reduced the shrimp population. The department confirmed the damage Thursday when the majority of shrimp caught during test trawling near Brunswick were dead, said Duane Harris, director of the department's coastal resources division. "The water temperatures got extremely low, probably as low as we've ever recorded. The majority of what we caught yesterday are dead," Harris said. "At this point we're reconsidering the decision to extend the season to January." The agency decided last month to extend the commercial season because shrimp were abundant in coastal waters. But, Harris said, that decision appears moot since most of the adult shrimp have died. He said the department wants to protect the small number of shrimp that survived the freezing temperatures. Commercial shrimpers are concerned about the weather's impact on juvenile shrimp, also known as "over-winter" shrimp, which make up the spawning population for the 1990 harvest, said Frank Mathews, owner of Mathews Seafood in Savannah. "There may have been damage to the juvenile shrimp that stayed on the inside (in shallow coastal waters), the ones that didn't migrate (to deeper, warmer water)," Mathews said. "Over-winter" shrimp do not migrate from shallow waters until spring when they mature and hatch a new crop of shrimp, Mathews said. Test trawling will continue next week throughout coastal Georgia, and Harris said he expects the news to become grimmer.

Title: BOND CORP. BREWERIES PUT IN RECEIVERSHIP; BUSINESS: AUSTRALIAN MEDIA SEE THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR CASH-STRAPPED HOLDING COMPANY.
Author: Associated Press
Abstract: null
Text: The Supreme Court of the state of Victoria today appointed receivers and managers for brewing interests held by Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. of Australia. Australian media speculated that the move marked the beginning of the end for the Bond empire, controlled by Alan Bond, chairman of the cash-strapped media, brewing, natural resources and property concern. The move also cast further doubt on the future of G. Heileman Brewing Co. of Milwaukee, owned by Bond. Earlier today, Bond Corp. disclosed a proposal to sell its Australian brewing assets, among Bond's main businesses. National Australia Bank Ltd., which requested the court action, is a major lender to Bond Corp. National Australia heads a syndicate of banks that it says is owed $695 million by Bond Corp. The banks include First National Bank of Boston, Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corp., Toronto Dominion Bank, Mitsubishi Trust & Banking Corp. and Standard Chartered PLC of Britain. In a statement issued late today, Bond Corp. said, "In light of the strong financial condition of the breweries, there is absolutely no foundation for the allegation that a serious deterioration in the business puts the lenders at risk." Bond, which immediately launched rival court action to fend off the receivership, said in a statement that the brewing units have not missed any principal or interest payments to the Australia bank-led syndicate. The Bond units included in today's court action include Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd., Bond Brewing Investments Pty., Swan Brewery Co., Castlemaine Perkins Ltd., Tooheys Ltd. and BBH Securities Pty. The court decision raised speculation that similar action might be taken by Bond's other creditors and force into receivership his entire group of companies controlled under the umbrella of Bond Corp. "In theory, it could trigger the repayment of every other facility we have," said Peter Lucas, executive director of Bond Corp. "It could bring Bond down."

Text: The mythical hero Hercules grimaces in agony, a bullet hole through his heart, as he wrestles with a centaur in a 17th-Century masterpiece at the Bucharest art museum. Machine-gun fire has ripped through the canvas by Italian painter Luca Giordano and bullet marks pock Alessandro Allori's tranquil 16th-Century "Mother with Child." The damage was caused when troops fired on the National Museum of Art during last week's fighting to flush out secret police snipers loyal to ousted Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu shooting from the roof. Art critic Dorana Cosoveanu sensed trouble when hundreds of angry demonstrators gathered in front of the presidential palace opposite the museum Dec. 21, booing Ceausescu. "I realized the people thought this was Ceausescu's house, they didn't know it was a museum. So I climbed out of a window and put up a sign saying " 'museum of art, please protect,' " she said. In the days of fighting that followed, the stately museum became a prime target, and its stone exterior is now pitted with shellfire. Some of the gunfire was so heavy it pounded through the walls and straight through paintings, hitting the walls on the other side. Museum Director Alexandru Cebuc said between 15% and 20% of the collection was damaged in the bombardment.

Abstract: null
Text: A radio talk show host who had just finished a program on racism said he received a death threat invoking the name of a Denver radio personality whose murder was linked to white supremacists. Mike Gallagher, whose talk show on WFBC-AM airs from 9 a.m. until noon, said he had just completed his shift Thursday when he received a telephone call from a man who identified himself only as "George from Anderson," a South Carolina town. Gallagher said the caller told him to "remember Alan Berg," the Denver talk show host who was gunned down in 1984. The slaying was linked to a white supremacist neo-Nazi group. Gallagher, who reported the incident to station officials, left WFBC around 2 p.m. to go to lunch. He said he found a note on his car windshield that included a racial remark, another reference to Berg and a warning that "you're a dead man." After the letter was discovered, station officials contacted authorities. The threat came after Gallagher and his callers discussed the controversy over a South Carolina sheriff who had been accused of using a racial slur. "I was very adamant about it, and we were batting it back and forth, and it got emotional," Gallagher said. "Apparently, a guy called the switchboard during the show and threatened my life." Greenville Police Detective Randy White said a preliminary investigation did not determine whether the threat was serious.

Text: HAPPY NEW YEAR to Jerry Kravat, who is an important part of the process. You can see him on the 31st, televised doing his "New Year's Eve at the Waldorf" thing with his orchestra, where he has conducted for the last eight years. Kravat was the natural successor to the late, great Guy Lombardo. On the last night of 1989, you'll also be able to hear Kravat bands in The Grand Bay, the Grand Hyatt, the Plaza Athenee, the Hudson River Club, the Mark, the Marriott Marquis, the Pierre, the Plaza and at Tavern on the Green, the spiffyest cafe for the holidays in all of New York. LOVED THE Christmas card from the "Designing Women" cast which sent greetings "from SOUTHERN California." (This show is very much set in the South, in Atlanta, in case you've been under a rock and have never had the joy of seeing it.) The four DWs -- Annie Potts, Delta Burke, Dixie Carter, Jean Smart -- are being joined by Dolly Parton for their New Year's Day special hour episode called "The First Day of the Last Decade of the Entire Twentieth Century." Writer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason put this episode together in only five days, from first word on paper to the final framing shot by her director hubby, Harry Thomason. The script was written on a Sunday, read by the cast on a Monday, and all costumes and sets were built over two days. Dolly Parton's stint as a "Guardian Movie Star" to the character Charlene should be a hoot. Another guest star will be actress Beah Richards who plays a 102-year-old woman representing the 20th Century. "Designing Women" has been asked by the Museum of Broadcasting to participate in its 7th Annual TV Festival in Los Angeles in March. The Festival will also salute Danny Thomas and Sheldon Leonard, the "Colgate Comedy Hour," "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," "Cheers" and CNN with Ted Turner. The L.A. County Museum of Art's 600-seat theater has been sold out for weeks. WHEN THE marvelous British actress Glynis Johns was only 19, she was the youngest ever to play the role of Peter Pan in London. So the other day, Glynis, now appearing with Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger in the romantic Broadway play "The Circle," was thrilled to pieces to welcome backstage Mary Martin. (Mary is America's own definitive Peter Pan from the musical version.) A trio of octogenarians were in to see "The Circle" over the holidays -- Katharine Hepburn . . . Claudette Colbert . . . Helen Hayes. Mary Martin couldn't come in with those ladies; she's only a septuagenarian. DON'T MISS Money magazine's article on how current beliefs and myths about the black middle class are way out in left field. The editors say the Bush Administration misrepresents reality by describing the BMC as healthy and growing, when -- in reality -- this group is "fragile and shrinking" under continuing assaults of racial discrimination. GUESS WHERE Broadway baby Mandy Patinkin will be Saturday night? The guy who set the Great White Way on its ear with his controversial one-man show earlier this year is going to repeat at the Concord Hotel in the Catskills. It marks Mandy's debut there. AS THE year winds down, here's a salute to the Malcolm Forbes column "Fact and Comment" which I turn to first each month in Forbes magazine. I liked Malcolm's upbeat assurance as to "What Sort of Year Will 1990 Be?" He says, "Not as tough as it now seems it might be."

Title: IRS FILES LIENS FOR 3 YEARS BACK TAXES OWED BY MARTIN
Author: Associated Press
Abstract: null
Text: One day after Billy Martin's death, the Internal Revenue Service filed three liens against the former New York Yankee manager's estate to recover $86,137 in back taxes. According to liens filed in the Broome County Clerk's office, the IRS is seeking to recover $10,988 in unpaid income taxes for 1981, $8,381 for 1982 and $66,767 for 1988. The government claims that Martin, identified in the liens as Alfred M. Martin, under-reported his income for those three years. Terry Dunford, a spokesman for the IRS in Buffalo, said today the timing of the liens was not intended as a cold-hearted slap against Martin's memory or his family. "We look at every case individually, and we file liens in cases involving deceased persons when we feel it is necessary to protect the interests of the U.S. government," Dunford told the Buffalo News.

Title: THOMAS MOWS DOWN FOES TO WIN NFL ROOKIE AWARD
Author: Associated Press
Abstract: null
Text: His selection as the NFL's defensive newcomer of the year hardly shocked Kansas City's Derrick Thomas. He had even identified his strongest challenger. "I've been watching Steve Atwater to see what he's doing every week," Thomas said Thursday when told he had swamped the Denver defensive back in voting by a panel of broadcasters and sportswriters for the Associated Press award. "And I think he was probably keeping tabs on me, too." If so, Atwater knew he had little chance of overtaking the Chiefs' rookie linebacker. Thomas' 10 sacks through 10 games helped turn a mediocre Kansas City defense into one of the top units in the league. The first defensive player taken in last year's college draft, Thomas is one of those rare athletes with the ability to make those around him better players. Still, his first year has not been free of pitfalls. "I didn't want to play like a rookie, but I'm afraid that sometimes I did," he said. "I'm nowhere close to where I eventually want to be. But I think I made a lot of progress. Physically, my body hasn't changed since I was in college. But mentally I'm getting to the point where I'm studying more and learning more and starting to know some of the things the old veterans know." Thomas was an easy winner for defensive rookie honors, collecting 43 1/2 votes to 22 1/2 for Atwater. The honor was not unexpected. NFL players had already voted Thomas into the Pro Bowl. "Everything was so new to me. It wasn't until about the sixth game that I really got to the point where I felt comfortable, where I could make my own decisions out there. In college, holding isn't permitted. Here, it is permitted. But next year I'll know what to expect. My goal next year is to be the best I can be."

Title: WORKERS AT RACE TRACKS CHANGE MINDS, OK PACT
Author: Times Wire Services
Abstract: null
Text: Union workers at Pimlico and Laurel race tracks voted today to accept the five-year contract they had rejected a week ago, averting a strike Monday. The contract replaces one that expires at midnight Sunday and covers about 660 pari-mutuel clerks, guards, parkers, admissions personnel, jockeys' room valets and the starting gate crew. The members of Local 27 of the United Food and Commercial Workers union had rejected the offer last week and authorized a strike despite the recommendation of union leaders that the track management's offer be accepted. The ratification vote was 310 to 39. It calls for top-scale wages for pari-mutuel clerks after eight years of continuous regular service. Today's vote meeting was tightly secured. The press was barred, as well as friends and family of union members. Union and track management officials met for about four hours Wednesday at a series of meetings arranged by federal mediator Leo Gant.

Title: HAGAN RAN FROM GANGS, NOW TOWARD THE HEISMAN
Author: TIM LAYDEN, NEWSDAY
Abstract: null
Text: Sometimes you run. Darian Hagan was a freshman in high school when he had to make his choice, such as it was. He lived in Watts, an angry ghetto that puts a bounty on many young lives (literally or figuratively) and was closing in on his. "I got chased home by gangs, shot at by gangs, everything," Hagan said. "But I didn't want any part of it." So he ran. First to his home and then to sports, in which he excelled on Locke High School's baseball and football teams, digging the tunnel that would take him out of Los Angeles and one day make him quarterback at Colorado and a Heisman Trophy finalist. He will start Monday night against Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, the game that can give the No. 1 Buffaloes their first national championship. Not all of Hagan's plays have been successful. He was a freshman last year, and Colorado was tied at 17 with Brigham Young in the fourth quarter of the Freedom Bowl. Sal Aunese, the Buffaloes' starter who has since been immortalized for his battle with cancer and subsequent death, could generate no offense. Coach Bill McCartney inserted Hagan, who promptly threw an interception that led to BYU's game-winning field goal. "Rough game for Darian," Colorado senior wide receiver Jeff Campbell said. "You could see the way he felt about it." He felt bad enough to approach quarterback Coach Gary Barnett and insist he be moved to running back. Not that the request was entirely radical -- several teams had recruited Hagan with intentions of moving him -- but Colorado wanted him to run its option offense. Hagan stuck with his decision through the winter. "I had no intention of playing quarterback," Hagan said. "My confidence was gone after that one game. I knew I could be a running back; a lot of people thought I was a running back playing quarterback, anyway. I went all through winter conditioning thinking that way, right up until a couple weeks before spring practice." That's when Aunese got sick. Barnett called Hagan to tell him Aunese would miss spring drills and probably the season, too. "I told him Sal had cancer," Barnett said. "He couldn't believe it. He said, 'I guess I'll have to grow up and be a man.' " The realization for Hagan was dramatic and sudden, if also opportune. And he seized it. "He had real big shoes to fill, and I tried to put my arm on his shoulder and console him any time he needed it," Bill Coleman, a senior offensive tackle and co-captain, said. "But as soon as he stuck his head into the huddle in spring practice, I could see he was ready." "I've felt guilty, a lot of the time, that I was given my starting position because somebody was stricken with a disease," Hagan said. "The coaches told me, 'Just be Darian,' but it was hard not to think about Sal."
